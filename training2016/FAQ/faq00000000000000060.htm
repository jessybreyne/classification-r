                                             <p>To figure the basis of property you receive as a gift, you must know its adjusted

                                             <p>The basis of stocks or bonds you own generally is the purchase price plus the costs

                                                or bonds other than by purchase, your basis is usually determined by fair market value

                                             <p>The basis of stock must be adjusted for certain events that occur after purchase.
                                                For example, if you receive more stock from nontaxable stock dividends or stock splits,
                                                you must reduce the basis of your original stock. You must also reduce your basis
                                                when you receive nontaxable distributions, because these are a return of capital.

                                                or loss is long-term.

                                             <p>Reverse splits are where your number of shares in a company's stock decreases.
                                                Your total basis remains the same; it is your per share basis that increases. You
                                                must divide your basis in the old shares by the number of new shares. For example,
                                                you own 4 shares of stock. Two of these shares have a basis of $15; each of the other
                                                two have a basis of $20 each. There is now a one for two reverse split. Now you have
                                                two shares. One has a basis of $30 the other has a basis of $40. If your receive cash
