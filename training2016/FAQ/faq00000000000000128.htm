                                                self-employment of $400 or more. This is the method by which self-employed

                                                there are no tax withholdings on this income. Thus, you may have been subject
                                                to the requirement to make quarterly estimated tax payments. If you did not

                                                of estimated tax. Employees pay into the social security and Medicare trust
                                                funds, as well as income tax withholding, through payroll deductions.

                                             <p>You may be required to compute gain on the disposition of the property
                                                and, under certain circumstances, may be eligible to claim a loss as well.
                                                The tax treatment of he disposition may be affected by whether the debt was
                                                recourse or nonrecourse. 
                                             </p>
                                             <p>If the debt was nonrecourse (you were not personally liable for payment),
                                                the amount realized for purposes of computing gain is the sum of the amount
                                                of money received, the fair market value of any other property received incident
                                                to the transfer of the property subject to foreclosure, and the amount of
                                                any nonrecourse debt on the property. The difference between the amount realized
                                                and your basis is your gain or loss. No portion of the gain on property subject
                                                only to nonrecourse debt is income from discharge of indebtedness.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>If the debt was recourse (you could have been held personally liable for
                                                payment), the proper treatment depends on the amount of the debt and whether
                                                you were discharged as a result of the transaction. If the debt was less than
                                                the fair market value of the property, the amount realized is equal to the
                                                sum of the amount received and the fair market value of any other property
                                                received incident to the transfer of the property subject to foreclosure,
                                                and the amount of any debt discharged as the result of the transaction. On
                                                the other hand, if the debt was more than the fair market value of the property
                                                and it was discharged as result of the transaction, for example, if you gave
                                                the creditor a deed in lieu of foreclosure, then the difference between the
                                                FMV of the property and the amount of the debt up to the FMV of the property
                                                is considered to be the amount realized and the excess debt is considered
                                                to be income from discharge of indebtedness. Your gain or loss would be computed
                                                by the difference between the FMV of the property and your basis; the balance
                                                would be ordinary income reportable on Line 21. If the debt was not discharged
                                                because of the foreclosure and the creditor could collect the difference from
                                                you, there would be no discharge of indebtedness income until such time as
                                                the debt was actually discharged or the statute of limitations expired. In
                                                such case, you might only have to report your gain on the disposition of the
                                                property.

                                                of tipping-out is one of the reasons you should keep a detailed daily log

                                                to be allocated, and, if so, how much. Employers who operate large food and

                                                of gross sales. Thus, when there is a tip-splitting arrangement, it is important
                                                that all tips, including those received through tip-splitting, be reported

                                             <p>No. The law requires that the employee who receives tips must report the
                                                actual tip amount to his or her employer if the amount is $20 or more for

                                                an employee is customarily tipped between 10% and 20%, reporting only 8% of
