                                                has important tax consequences. Worker classification affects how you pay your Federal
                                                income tax, social security and Medicare taxes, and how you file your tax return.
                                                The classification also affects your eligibility for employee benefits. Those who
                                                should be classified as employees, but aren't, may lose out on workers' compensation,
                                                unemployment benefits, and, in many cases, group insurance (including life and health),
                                                and retirement benefits.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Certain workers are considered employees by statute for purposes of the Federal
                                                Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), or for
                                                federal income tax withholding from wages. Examples of workers considered employees
                                                by statute include corporate officers, certain agent, or commision-drivers, full-time
                                                life insurance sales persons, certain home workers, certain traveling of city sales
                                                persons.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Where there is no controlling statute, a worker's status is determined by applying
                                                the common law test, which applies for purposes of FICA, FUTA, Federal income tax
                                                withholding, and the Railroad Retirement Tax Act. A worker's status under the common
                                                law test is determined by applying relevant facts that fall into three main categories:
                                                behavioral control, financial control, and the type of relationship itself. In each
                                                case, it is very important to consider all the facts - no single fact provides the
                                                answer.
                                             </p>
                                             <p><em type="bit">BEHAVIORAL CONTROL:</em> These facts show whether there is a right
                                                to direct or control how the worker does the work. A worker is an employee when the
                                                business has the right to direct and control the worker. The business does not have
                                                to actually direct or control the way the work is done -- as long as the employer
                                                has the right to direct and control the work. For example:
                                                
                                                <li><em type="bld"> Instructions</em> -- if you receive extensive instructions on
                                                   how work is to be done, this suggests that you may be an employee. Instructions can
                                                   cover a wide range of topics, for example: how, when, or where to do the work, what
                                                   tools or equipment to use, what assistants to hire to help with the work, and where
                                                   to purchase supplies and services. If you receive less extensive instructions about
                                                   what should be done, but not how it should be done, you may be an independent contractor.
                                                   For instance, instructions about time and place may be less important than directions
                                                   on how the work is performed.

                                                   required procedures and methods, this suggests that the business wants the work done
                                                   in a certain way, and you may be an employee.

                                                   test, the investment must have substance. However, a significant investment is not
                                                   necessary to be an independent contractor.

                                                a special payment separate from the regular wage payment, and pay only the wage amount
                                                on the other payroll dates?</strong></span><p>
                                             <p>An employer can report an employee's tip income and withhold taxes once a month
                                                or more often than once a month. The two items of practical consideration, besides
                                                the sophistication of your payroll system, are the employees' tip reports and the
                                                charged tips.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>The employees are required by law to report their cash tips only once a month,
                                                by the 10th day of the month following the month for which they are reporting. The
                                                employer may require the employees to report their tips more often. This would facilitate
                                                withholding on tips and the reporting of the tips as income on the employees' pay
                                                stubs.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>When an employer makes the charged tips available to the employee may depend on
                                                the employer's policy. The employee monthly tip report should include information
                                                about charged tips that the employer has paid to the employee during the reporting
                                                period, as well as tips paid directly to the employee.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>It would be most practical for withholding purposes for the employer to report
                                                the tip income for each employee when all the tip information is available and the
                                                payments for charged items are available. If, when the employee is paid, there is
                                                not enough money available to withhold all taxes owed on wages and tips, the employer
                                                can withhold the remaining amount from the next paycheck or the employee can give
                                                money to the employer to cover the withholding.

                                                Such an agreement would be allowed if the employees will be paid wages by the new
                                                owner in the same calendar year and the Forms W-2 furnished to these employees will
                                                contain the required information , i.e. wages paid and taxes withheld, from both employers.
                                                The new employer will furnish Forms W-2 to the employees and will also file the required
                                                Forms W-2 and W-3 with the Social Security Administration. These actions will follow
                                                the normal end-of-year time lines. You will remain responsible for the Form W-2 and
                                                W-3 reporting obligations for the employees who are not employed by the new owner.

                                             <p>If someone owes you money that you cannot collect, you have a bad debt. Bad debts
                                                are deductible only if the amount owed has been previously included in your income.
                                                For a discussion of what constitutes a valid debt, see <a href="/publications/p535/index.html">Publication 535</a>, <em type="itl"> Business

                                                If you are a cash basis taxpayer, as most individuals are, you may not take a bad
                                                debt deduction for expected income you have not received, since it was never included
                                                in your income. There are two kinds of bad debts - business and nonbusiness.

                                             <p> A business bad debt, generally, is one that comes from operating your trade or
                                                business. A business deducts its bad debts from gross income when figuring its taxable
                                                income. Business bad debts may be deducted in part or in full.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>All other bad debts are nonbusiness. Nonbusiness bad debts must be totally worthless
                                                to be deductible. You cannot deduct a partially worthless nonbusiness bad debt. You
                                                must establish that you have taken reasonable steps to collect the debt and that the
                                                debt is worthless. It is not necessary to go to court if you can show that a judgment
                                                from the court would be uncollectible. You may take the deduction only in the year
                                                the debt becomes worthless. A debt becomes worthless when the surrounding facts and
                                                circumstances indicate there is no longer any chance the amount owed will be paid.
                                                You do not have to wait until the debt comes due.

                                             <p>The proper classification of your investment activities is important to determine
                                                how income and expenses are to be reported. Investors trade solely for their own account
                                                and do not carry on a trade or business. Their securities sales result in capital
                                                gain or loss and their deductible expenses are itemized deductions. Dealers sell securities

                                                gain or loss and their deductible expenses are trade or business expenses. Traders
                                                buy and sell securities frequently but have no customers. Their purchases and sales
                                                result in capital gain and loss, and their deductible expenses are trade or business
                                                expenses.

                                                movements, and do not personally engage in or direct the purchases or sales. An investor

                                             <p>In general, a partner loss is allocated base on his/her percentage of ownership
                                                of the year. This percentage is referred to as the partner's distributive share. The
                                                partners' distributive share of items is reported to the partner on Schedule K-1 (Form
                                                1065). A partner's distributive share of partnership loss is allowed only to the extent
                                                of the adjusted basis of the partner's partnership interest. A loss that is more than
                                                the partner's adjusted basis is not deductible. For additional deductibility of partnership

                                             <p>This type of corporation can deduct capital losses only up to the amount of capital
                                                gains. If capital losses exceed capital gains, the excess is first carried back three
                                                years prior to the loss year and used to offset capital gains. Then, any unused loss
                                                is carried forward up to five years from the loss year to offset capital gains in
                                                those years. If the corporation is dissolved, the loss is not carried to any other

                                             <p>When carrying a capital loss from one year to another, the following rules apply:</p>
                                             <p>1. When figuring the current year capital loss, you cannot combine it with a capital
                                                loss carried another year. In other words, you can carry capital losses only to years
                                                that would otherwise have a net capital gain.

                                             <p>2. If you carry capital losses from 2 or more years to the same year, deduct the
                                                loss from the earliest year first.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>3. You cannot use a capital loss carried from another year to produce or increase
                                                a net operating loss in the year to which you carry it back.

                                             <p>Corporation must include capital gain in full in gross but only to the extent they
                                                exceed capital losses. A corporation is taxed on net capital gain at the regular tax
                                                rate, including the additional phase-out rates for high-income corporations. See <a href="/pub/irs-pdf/i1120_a.pdf">

                                                to the 1040. Therefore, the due date is the same as the 1040.
