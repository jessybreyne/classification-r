<br />

<hr size="1" noshade class="rule" />

<br />
 
<b>How do I get permission to use somebody else's work?</b><br />
You can ask for it. If you know who the copyright owner is, you 
may contact the owner directly. If you are not certain about the 
ownership or have other related questions, you may wish to request 
that the Copyright Office conduct a search of its records or you 
may search yourself. See the next question for more details.

<br /><br />
						
<b>How can I find out who owns a copyright?</b><br />
We can provide you with the information available in 
our records. A search of registrations, renewals, and recorded 
transfers of ownership made before 1978 requires a manual search 
of our files. Upon request, our staff will search our records 
at the statutory rate of $75 for each hour. There is no fee if 
you conduct a search in person at the Copyright Office. Copyright 
registrations made and documents recorded from 1978 to date are 
available for searching online. For further information, see
<a href="/circs/circ22.html">Circular 22</a>, <i>How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work</i>, 
and <a href="/circs/circ23.html">Circular 23</a>, <i>Copyright Card Catalog and the Online File</i>.

            <br /><br />
 
<b>How can I obtain copies of someone else's work and/or registration certificate?</b><br />
The Copyright Office will not honor a request for a copy 
of someone else's protected work without written authorization 
from the copyright owner or from his or her designated agent, 
unless the work is involved in litigation. In the latter case, 
a litigation statement is required. A certificate of registration 
for any registered work can be obtained for a fee of $30. <a href="/circs/circ6.html">Circular 6</a>, <i>Access to and Copies of Copyright Records and Deposit</i>, 
provides additional information.

<br /><br />
 
<b>How much of someone else's work can I use without getting permission?</b><br />
Under the <i>fair use</i> doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, 
it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including 
quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, 
and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the 
use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical 
notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies 
as fair use depends on all the circumstances. See <a href="/fls/fl102.html">FL 
102</a>, Fair Use, and <a href="/circs/circ21.pdf">Circular 
21</a>, <i>Reproductions of Copyrighted Works by Educators and 
Librarians</i>. 

<br /><br />

<b>How much do I have to change in order to claim copyright in someone else's work?</b><br />
Only the owner of copyright in a work has the right to prepare, 
or to authorize someone else to create, a new version of that 
work. Accordingly, you cannot claim copyright to another's work, 
no matter how much you change it, unless you have the owner's 
consent. See <a href="/circs/circ14.html">Circular 
14</a>, <i>Copyright Registration for Derivative Works</i>. 

<br /><br />

<b>Somebody infringed my copyright. What can I do? </b><br />
A party may seek to protect his or her copyrights against unauthorized 
use by filing a civil lawsuit in federal district court. If you 
believe that your copyright has been infringed, consult an attorney. 
In cases of willful infringement for profit, the U.S. Attorney 
may initiate a criminal investigation.

<br /><br />

<b>Could I be sued for using somebody else's work? How about quotes or samples?</b><br />
If you use a copyrighted work without authorization, the owner 
may be entitled to bring an infringement action against you. There 
are circumstances under the <a href="/fls/fl102.html">fair use</a> 
doctrine where a quote or a sample may be used without permission. 
However, in cases of doubt, the Copyright Office recommends that 
permission be obtained.

<br /><br />
 
<b>Do you have a list of songs or movies in the public domain?</b><br />
No, we neither compile nor maintain such a list. A search of our 
records, however, may reveal whether a particular work has fallen 
into the public domain. We will conduct a search of our records 
by the title of a work, an author's name, or a claimant's name. 
The search fee is $75 per hour. You may also search the records 
in person without paying a fee.

<br /><br />

<b>I saw an image on the Library of Congress website that I would like to use. Do I need to obtain permission?</b><br />
With few exceptions, the Library of Congress does not own copyright 
in the materials in its collections and does not grant or deny permission 
to use the content mounted on its website. Responsibility for making 
an independent legal assessment of an item from the Library&#8217;s 
collections and for securing any necessary permissions rests with 
persons desiring to use the item. To the greatest extent possible, 
the Library attempts to provide any known rights information about 
its collections. Such information can be found in the &#8220;Copyright 
and Other Restrictions&#8221; statements on each <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/">American 
Memory</a> online collection homepage. If the image is not part 
of the American Memory collections, contact the Library custodial 
division to which the image is credited. Bibliographic records and 
finding aids available in each custodial division include information 
that may assist in assessing the copyright status. Search our catalogs 
through the Library's <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/">Online Catalog</a>. 
To access information from the Library&#8217;s reading rooms, go 
to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/research-centers.html">Research 
Centers</a>.

<br /><br />

<b>Is it legal to download works from peer-to-peer networks and if not, what is the penalty for doing so?</b><br />
Uploading or downloading works protected by copyright without the authority of the copyright owner is an infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive rights of reproduction and/or distribution. Anyone found to have infringed a copyrighted work may be liable for statutory damages up to $30,000 for each work infringed and, if willful infringement is proven by the copyright owner, that amount may be increased up to $150, 000 for each work infringed. In addition, an infringer of a work may also be liable for the attorney's fees incurred by the copyright owner to enforce his or her rights.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not a particular work is being made available under the authority of the copyright owner is a question of fact. But since any original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium (including a computer file) is protected by federal copyright law upon creation, in the absence of clear information to the contrary, most works may be assumed to be protected by federal copyright law.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the files distributed over peer-to-peer networks are primarily copyrighted works, there is a risk of liability for downloading material from these networks. To avoid these risks, there are currently many "authorized" services on the Internet that allow consumers to purchase copyrighted works online, whether music, ebooks, or motion pictures. By purchasing works through authorized services, consumers can avoid the risks of infringement liability and can limit their exposure to other potential risks, e.g., viruses, unexpected material, or spyware.
