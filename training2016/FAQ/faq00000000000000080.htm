                                             <p>An employer can report an employee's tip income and withhold taxes once a month
                                                or more often than once a month. The two items of practical consideration, besides
                                                the sophistication of your payroll system, are the employees' tip reports and the

                                                employer may require the employees to report their tips more often. This would facilitate

                                             <p>When an employer makes the charged tips available to the employee may depend on
                                                the employer's policy. The employee monthly tip report should include information
                                                about charged tips that the employer has paid to the employee during the reporting
                                                period, as well as tips paid directly to the employee.

                                             <p>It would be most practical for withholding purposes for the employer to report
                                                the tip income for each employee when all the tip information is available and the
                                                payments for charged items are available. If, when the employee is paid, there is
                                                not enough money available to withhold all taxes owed on wages and tips, the employer
                                                can withhold the remaining amount from the next paycheck or the employee can give
                                                money to the employer to cover the withholding.

                                             <p>To figure the advance EIC payment, you may use either the Wage Bracket Method or
                                                the Percentage Method  explained in <a href="/publications/p15/index.html">Publication 15</a>, <em> Circular E, Employer's
                                                   Tax Guide </em>. You may use other methods for figuring advance EIC payments if the
                                                amount of the payment is about the same as it would be using tables in Publication
                                                15. See the tolerance allowed in the chart in section 9 of <a href="/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf">Publication 15-A</a> (PDF) , <em> Supplemental Employer's Tax Guide. </em> See section
                                                10 in Publication 15 for an explanation of the advance payment of the EIC.

                                             <p> Add the advance earned income credit payments to the employee's net pay for the
                                                pay period. Since this amount isn't wages, you do not withhold any income, social
                                                security, or Medicare taxes from the payment.
