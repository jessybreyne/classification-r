                                             <p>If someone owes you money that you cannot collect, you have a bad debt. Bad debts
                                                are deductible only if the amount owed has been previously included in your income.
                                                For a discussion of what constitutes a valid debt, see <a href="/publications/p535/index.html">Publication 535</a>, <em> Business
                                                   Expenses </em> and <a href="/publications/p550/index.html">Publication 550</a>, <em> Investment Income and Expenses </em>.
                                                If you are a cash basis taxpayer, as most individuals are, you may not take a bad
                                                debt deduction for expected income you have not received, since it was never included
                                                in your income. There are two kinds of bad debts - business and nonbusiness.
                                             </p>
                                             <p> A business bad debt, generally, is one that comes from operating your trade or
                                                business. A business deducts its bad debts from gross income when figuring its taxable
                                                income. Business bad debts may be deducted in part or in full.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>All other bad debts are nonbusiness. Nonbusiness bad debts must be totally worthless
                                                to be deductible. You cannot deduct a partially worthless nonbusiness bad debt. You
                                                must establish that you have taken reasonable steps to collect the debt and that the
                                                debt is worthless. It is not necessary to go to court if you can show that a judgment
                                                from the court would be uncollectible. You may take the deduction only in the year
                                                the debt becomes worthless. A debt becomes worthless when the surrounding facts and
                                                circumstances indicate there is no longer any chance the amount owed will be paid.
                                                You do not have to wait until the debt comes due.

                                                interest). A trader gain or loss on sale of securities is reported as capital gain
                                                or loss on <a href="/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sd.pdf"> Form 1040, Schedule D</a> (PDF) unless they have

                                             <p>The proper classification of your investment activities is important to determine
                                                how income and expenses are to be reported. Investors trade solely for their own account
                                                and do not carry on a trade or business. Their securities sales result in capital
                                                gain or loss and their deductible expenses are itemized deductions. Dealers sell securities
                                                to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business. Their sales result in ordinary
                                                gain or loss and their deductible expenses are trade or business expenses. Traders
                                                buy and sell securities frequently but have no customers. Their purchases and sales
                                                result in capital gain and loss, and their deductible expenses are trade or business
                                                expenses.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Even if you engage in extensive securities activities, you are an investor, not
                                                a dealer or trader, if you do not seek profit primarily in swings in daily market
                                                movements, and do not personally engage in or direct the purchases or sales. An investor
                                                trades for profit-motivated reasons such as long-term appreciation, dividends and
                                                interest. Whether the activities of an individual constitute trade or business or
                                                investment is determined from the facts in each case. These distinctions have been
                                                established through court cases.
