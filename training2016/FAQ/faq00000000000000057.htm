                                             <p>The proper year for reporting income depends on your method of accounting
                                                (cash or accrual). The majority of taxpayers filing Form 1040 use the cash
                                                method of accounting. Cash method taxpayers report the items of income in
                                                the year in which the income was actually or constructively received. For
                                                cash method taxpayers, the year that the income is earned is irrelevant.

                                             <p>With respect to "actual receipt," if you receive an item of income that
                                                is paid to you by check, your receipt of that check is taxable to you as if
                                                it were cash. 
                                             </p>
                                             <p>With respect to "constructive receipt," constructive receipt occurs when
                                                the income is made available to you. For example, you are in constructive
                                                receipt of income paid to you by check if the check has been cut and is readily
                                                available to you, even though you have not picked it up as planned. Also,
                                                you are in constructive receipt of bank interest when it has been credited

                                             <p>An offer in compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the
                                                Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that resolves the taxpayer's tax liability.
                                                The IRS has the authority to settle, or compromise, federal tax liabilities
                                                by accepting less than a full payment under certain circumstances. The IRS
                                                may legally compromise for one of the following reasons:
                                                
                                                <li><em type="bld">Doubt as to Liability:</em> Doubt exists that the assessed
                                                   tax is correct.
                                                </li>
                                                
                                                <li> <em type="bld">Doubt as to Collectibility:</em> Doubt exists that the
                                                   taxpayer could ever pay the full amount of tax owed. The minimum offer amount
                                                   must generally be equal to (or greater than) the taxpayer's reasonable collection
                                                   potential (RCP). The RCP is defined as the total of the taxpayer's realizable
                                                   value in real and personal assets, plus his/her future income.

                                             <p><em type="bld">Note</em>: Unless the taxpayer files an OIC claiming special
                                                circumstances, the offered amount must equal or exceed the reasonable collection
                                                potential. Realizable value is the asset's quick sale value (amount which
                                                could be reasonably expected through the sale of the asset) minus what the
                                                taxpayer owes to a secured creditor.
                                                
                                                <li><em type="bld">Effective Tax Administration</em>: There is no doubt that
                                                   the tax is correct and no doubt that the amount owed could be collected in
                                                   full, but exceptional circumstances exist such that collection of the full
                                                   amount would create economic hardship or where compelling public policy or
                                                   equity considerations provide sufficient basis for compromise. The taxpayer
                                                   bears the burden of proof to show their OIC qualifies for public policy or
                                                   equity considerations. They must show that their circumstances are compelling
                                                   enough to justify acceptance of their OIC compared to other taxpayers in similar

                                                for each month, or part of a month, that the tax remains unpaid after the
                                                due date, not exceeding 25 percent. However, you will not have to pay the
                                                penalty if you can show reasonable cause for the failure. The one-half of

                                             <p>Beginning January 1, 2000, if you filed a timely return and are paying
                                                your tax pursuant to an installment agreement, the penalty is one-quarter
                                                of one percent for each month, or part of a month, that the installment agreement

                                             <p>If you did not file on time and owe tax, you may owe an additional penalty
                                                for failure to file unless you can show reasonable cause. The combined penalty
                                                is 5 percent (4.5% late filing, 0.5% late payment) for each month, or part
                                                of a month, that your return was late, up to 25%. The late filing penalty
                                                applies to the net amount due, which is the tax shown on your return and any
                                                additional tax found to be due, as reduced by any credits for withholding
                                                and estimated tax and any timely payments made with the return. After five
                                                months, if you still have not paid, the 0.5% failure-to-pay penalty continues
                                                to run, up to 25%, until the tax is paid. Thus, the total penalty for failure
                                                to file and pay can be 47.5% (22.5% late filing, 25% late payment) of the
                                                tax owed. Also, if your return was over 60 days late, the minimum failure-to-file
                                                penalty is the smaller of $100 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on
                                                the return.

                                             <p>Interest is charged on any unpaid tax from the due date of the return until

                                                is the federal short-term rate plus 3 percent. Interest is compounded daily.
                                                If you paid the net amount of tax that was due based on the tax shown on the
                                                return, and later determine that more tax should have been shown on the return,
                                                you will incur a failure to pay penalty. Additionally, when IRS bills you
                                                for any tax, penalty, or interest, if you do not pay the bill within 21 calendar
                                                days (10 business days if the amount equals or exceeds $100,000), a late payment

                                                failure.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>If you file on time but don't pay the net amount due based on the tax shown
                                                on the return, you will generally have to pay a late payment penalty of one-half
                                                of one percent of the tax owed for each month, or part of a month, that the
                                                tax remains unpaid after the due date, up to 25 percent. However, you will
                                                not have to pay the penalty if you can show reasonable cause for the failure.

                                             <p>Yes, if your part-time job is with a different employer. Each employer
                                                is responsible for withholding on wages subject to social security up to the

                                                responsible for determining any amount withheld by another employer. Consequently,
                                                with two or more employers, too much social security will be withheld if your
                                                total wages exceed the annual wage limit. (The wage limit is adjusted annually
                                                for inflation.) That is the reason there is a credit for excess social security
                                                and RRTA withheld. It is in the "Payments" section of Forms 1040 and 1040A
                                                so that if it is not needed to apply against tax owed, it is refunded to you.
