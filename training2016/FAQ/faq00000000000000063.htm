                                             <p>The 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 modified
                                                the bonus depreciation rule by substituting a 50% special depreciation allowance
                                                for the 30%, for property acquired after May 5, 2003 and before January 1,
                                                2005. No binding contract for acquisition can be in effect before May 6, 2003.
                                                Property eligible for the 50% additional first-year depreciation is not eligible
                                                for the 30% additional first-year depreciation. However, an election can be
                                                made to have the 30% additional first-year depreciation deduction apply to
                                                the 50% depreciation property instead of the 50% additional firs-year depreciation
                                                deduction. It is also possible to elect not to claim the additional first-year
                                                depreciation.

                                             <p>The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 modified the
                                                bonus depreciation rule by substituting a 50% special depreciation allowance
                                                for the 30%, for property acquired after May 5, 2003 and before January 1,
                                                2005. No binding contract for acquisition can be in effect before May 6, 2003.
                                                Property eligible for the 50% additional first-year depreciation is not eligible
                                                for the 30% additional first-year depreciation. However, an election can be
                                                made to have the 30% additional first-year depreciation deduction apply to
                                                50% depreciation property instead of the 50% additional first year depreciation
                                                deduction. It is also possible to elect not to claim the additional first-year
                                                depreciation deduction.

                                                add to the value of your property or substantially prolong its life. The items

                                                which they are attached. Since the property is residential rental property,
                                                the items are generally depreciated over 27.5 years using the straight line

                                             <p>Repairs, such as repainting the house, are currently deductible expenses.
                                                A repair keeps your property in good operating condition. It does not materially
                                                add to the value of your property or substantially prolong its life. Repainting
                                                your property inside or out, fixing gutters or floors, fixing leaks, plastering,
                                                and replacing broken windows are examples of repairs. If you make repairs
                                                as part of an extensive remodeling or restoration of your property, the whole
                                                job is an improvement. In that case, you should capitalize and depreciate
                                                the repair costs as the same class of property that you have restored or remodeled

                                                recaptured? Is it the amount of depreciation taken in the prior years or the
                                                depreciation left?</strong></span><p>
                                             <p>Generally, the amount of depreciation you must recapture for residential
                                                rental or nonresidential real property is the excess of the depreciation allowed
                                                or allowable over straight line depreciation for the property. Thus, if you
                                                sell a building placed in service after 1986 which required the use of the
                                                straight-line method, you would not have any depreciation to recapture. However,
                                                if you took the 30% special depreciation allowance for your building, this
                                                allowance may be subject to recapture. For property placed in service in 1986

                                             <p>What you have heard about is a like-kind exchange. A like-kind exchange,
                                                when properly executed, represents a way to postpone the recognition (taxation)
                                                of gain essentially by shifting the basis of old property to new property.
                                                If, in addition to giving up like-kind property, you pay money in a like-kind
                                                exchange, you still have no recognized gain or loss. The basis of the property
                                                received is the basis of the property given up, increased by the money paid.
                                                There are several rules and restrictions that must be strictly adhered to
                                                in order for a successful exchange to take place. Deferred exchanges will
                                                be treated as a sale rather than an exchange to the extent that the taxpayer
                                                actually or constructively receives money or other (not like kind) property

                                                thirty years ago (before she passed away) and I want to know how to figure

                                                is it just half?</strong></span><p>
                                             <p>The answer depends on in which state you live in. Generally, the basis
                                                of property you inherit is its Fair Market Value (FMV) at the date of the
                                                decedent's death. If you live in a community property state (Arizona, California,
                                                Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), and
                                                inherit your spouse's interest in a property held as community property, then
                                                the basis for the entire property becomes the FMV at the date of your spouse's
                                                death. This also assumes that at least half the value of the community property
                                                interest is included in the deceased spouse's gross estate. In other states,
                                                where the property is owned by you and your spouse as joint tenants, tenants
                                                by the entireties, or tenants-in-common, the basis of the one-half that your
                                                spouse owned would be increased to one-half of the FMV of the property at
                                                the date of death. The basis in the one-half that you owned would remain at
                                                the one-half of the pre-death adjusted basis. The new adjusted basis is, naturally,
                                                subject to all future routine basis adjustments until the property is either
                                                sold or otherwise disposed of.
