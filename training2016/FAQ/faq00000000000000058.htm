                                             <p>To figure the basis of property you get as a gift, you must know its adjusted basis
                                                to the donor just before it was given to you. You also must know its fair market value
                                                (FMV) at the time it was given to you. If the FMV of the property at the time of the
                                                gift is less than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis depends on whether you have
                                                a gain or loss when you dispose of the property. Your basis for figuring gain is the
                                                same as the donor's adjusted basis, plus or minus any required adjustments to basis
                                                while you held the property. Your basis for figuring a loss is the FMV of the property
                                                when you received the gift, plus or minus any required adjustments to basis while
                                                you held the property. See Adjusted Basis in <a href="/publications/p551/index.html">Publication 551</a>, <em type="itl">Basis of Assets</em>.

                                             <p>If you use the donor's adjusted basis for figuring a gain and get a loss, and then
                                                use the FMV for figuring a loss and get a gain, you have neither a gain or loss on

                                             <p>If the FMV is equal to or greater than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis is
                                                the donor's adjusted basis at the time you received the gift. Increase your basis
                                                by all or part of any gift tax paid, depending on the date of the gift. Also, for
                                                figuring gain or loss, you must increase or decrease your basis by any required adjustments
                                                to basis while you held the property. See Adjusted Basis in Publication 551,<em type="itl"> Basis
                                                   of Assets.</em></p>
                                             <p>If you received a gift before 1977, increase your basis in the gift (the donor's
                                                adjusted basis) by any gift tax paid on it. However, do not increase your basis above
                                                the FMV of the gift at the time it was given to you.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>If you received a gift after 1976, increase your basis by the part of the gift
                                                tax paid on it that is due to the net increase in value of the gift. Figure the increase
                                                to basis by multiplying the gift tax paid by the following fraction. The numerator
                                                of the fraction is the net increase in value of the gift and the denominator is the
                                                amount of the gift.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>The net increase in value of the gift is the FMV of the gift less the donor's adjusted
                                                basis. The amount of the gift is its value for gift tax purposes, after reduction
                                                by any annual exclusion and any marital or charitable deduction that applies to the
                                                gift. For more information on the gift tax, please see <a href="/publications/p950/index.html">Publication 950</a>, <em type="itl">Introduction

                                                the time it was given to you, and the amount of any gift tax paid on it.

                                             <p>If the FMV of the property was less than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis
                                                for figuring gain on its sale or other disposition is the same as the donor's adjusted
                                                basis plus or minus any required adjustment to basis during the period you held the
                                                property. Your basis for figuring loss on its sale or other disposition is its FMV
                                                at the time you received the gift plus or minus any required adjustment to basis during

                                                your basis for figuring gain or loss on its sale or other disposition is the same
                                                as the donor's adjusted basis at the time you received the gift. Increase your basis
                                                by all or part of any gift tax paid, depending on the date of the gift.

                                             <p>The basis of stocks or bonds you own generally is the purchase price plus the costs

                                                or bonds other than by purchase, your basis is usually determined by fair market value

                                                For example, if you receive more stock from nontaxable stock dividends or stock splits,
                                                you must reduce the basis of your original stock. You must also reduce your basis
                                                when you receive nontaxable distributions, because these are a return of capital.

                                                Your total basis remains the same; it is your per share basis that increases. You
                                                must divide your basis in the old shares by the number of new shares. For example,
                                                you own 4 shares of stock. Two of these shares have a basis of $15; each of the other
                                                two have a basis of $20 each. There is now a one for two reverse split. Now you have
                                                two shares. One has a basis of $30 the other has a basis of $40. If your receive cash

                                             <p>Unless you have acquired shares through gifts or inheritances, your basis is what

                                                and substantiate with records. You may lose a large part of your basis if you cannot

                                             <p>In order to figure your gain or loss using an average basis, you must have acquired
                                                the shares at various times and prices and have left them on deposit in a managed
                                                account.

                                             <p>There are two average basis methods:
                                                
                                                <li>Single-category method, and</li>

                                             </p>
                                             <p>Single-category method. First, add up the cost of all the shares you own in the
                                                mutual fund. Divide that result by the total number of shares you own. This gives
                                                you your average per share. Multiply that number by the number of shares sold.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Double-category method. First, divide your shares into two categories, long-term
                                                and short-term. Then use the steps above to get an average basis for each category.
                                                The average basis for that category is then the basis of each share in the sale from
                                                that category.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Once you elect to use an average basis method, you must continue to use it for
                                                all accounts in the same fund. You must clearly identify on your tax return the average
                                                basis method that you have elected to use. You do this identification by including

                                             <p>A mutual fund is a regulated investment company that pools funds of investors allowing
                                                them to take advantage of a diversity of investments and professional asset management.
                                                You own shares in the fund, but the fund owns assets such as shares of stock, corporate
                                                bonds, government obligations, etc. One of the ways the fund makes money for its investors
                                                is to sell these assets at a gain. If the asset was held by the mutual fund for more
                                                than one year, the nature of the income is capital gain, which gets passed on to you.
                                                These are called capital gain distributions, which are distinguished on <a href="/pub/irs-pdf/f1099d03.pdf"> Form 1099-DIV</a> (PDF) , from income that is from other profits, called
                                                ordinary dividends.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Capital gains distribution are taxed as long term capital gains regardless of how
                                                long you have owned the shares in the mutual fund. If your capital gains distribution
                                                is automatically reinvested, the reinvested amount is the basis of the additional
                                                shares purchased.

                                                1099-DIV, or "consolidated statements," some confusion has arisen regarding short-term
                                                capital gains. The purpose of Form 1099-DIV is to provide you with information to
                                                report income correctly on your tax return.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>The annual report often breaks down the income from fund activity as dividends,
                                                tax-exempt dividends, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains, returns of
                                                capital, and undistributed capital gains. Form 1099-DIV, on the other hand, will show
                                                only ordinary dividends (which includes the fund's short-term capital gains), capital
                                                gain distributions, and returns of capital (nontaxable distributions), and qualified
                                                dividends.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Mutual fund companies may combine the annual fund information with the Form 1099-DIV
                                                information into a consolidated statement. If this is what you receive, look for the
                                                part of the statement identified as the Form 1099-DIV or that contains language such
                                                as "in lieu of Form 1099-DIV."
