                                             <p>Starting in 1998, taxpayers who have taken out qualified loans to pay certain

                                                spouse, or their dependent are allowed to take a deduction from gross income
                                                for the interest they paid on these student loans. Prior to 2002, deduction
                                                of student loan interest was limited to the first 60 months of required interest
                                                payments, and, was subject to income limitations. Beginning in 2002, interest

                                                totally worthless. A debt becomes totally worthless when there is no longer

                                                for federal disaster assistance, you can choose to deduct that loss on your
                                                return for the year immediately preceding the loss year. In other words, you
                                                may treat the loss as having occurred in either the current year or the previous
                                                year, whichever provides the best tax results for you. If you have already

                                                standard or itemized, will be the deduction to choose, since it will lower
