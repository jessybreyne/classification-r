                                             <p> United States citizens living abroad are required to file annual U.S. income tax

                                                for their filing status and age. You must contact the Canadian Government to determine
                                                whether you must file a Canadian tax return and pay Canadian taxes. For the United

                                                claiming a foreign tax credit or excluding some or all of your foreign earned income.

                                             <p>You must comply with both U.S. and Canadian filing requirements. In the United

                                             <p>Foreign currency needs to be translated into U.S. dollars to determine the amount
                                                of income (such as income from the sale of goods or services, dividends or interest)

                                                is disposed of. The proper translation rate depends on the item of income and whether
                                                the taxpayer is a cash or accrual method taxpayer.

                                                to be accrued (because, for example, the taxpayer is an individual holding a debt
                                                instrument that does not have original issue discount) is translated at the spot rate
                                                on the date received. Interest income that is required to be accrued is translated
                                                at the average rate for each accrual period. When such interest is received the taxpayer
                                                will realize foreign currency gain or loss based on the difference in exchange rates
                                                used to accrue the interest and the spot rate on the date such interest is received.
                                                (A taxpayer may also realize foreign currency gain or loss on the principal when the
                                                instrument is sold or matures.)

                                             <p>. <em type="bit"> Payable and receivables </em>. An accrual basis taxpayer may
                                                also realize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to a foreign currency denominated
                                                payable or receivable. Generally, foreign currency gain or loss is computed by reference
                                                to the change in exchange rates between the time the payable or receivable arises
                                                and when it is paid or received. For example, if an accrual basis taxpayer sells a
                                                product for L100 when L1= $1 with payment to occur in 90 days and receives payment
                                                of L100 when L1 = $1.20, the taxpayer will realize $20 ($120 - $100) of foreign currency
                                                gain. It should be noted that in certain circumstances, taxpayers may use spot rate
                                                conventions if consistent with the taxpayer method of financial accounting.

                                             <p>You can generally get the exchange rates from banks and U.S. Embassies. Other possible
                                                sources of exchange rate would be publications, such as the Wall Street Journal. If

                                                For the part of the year you are a resident alien, you are taxed on income from all
                                                sources.

                                             <p>For the part of the year that you are not a resident alien, you are not taxed on
                                                income from sources outside the United States, unless the income is effectively connected
                                                with a trade or business in the United States.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Income from U.S. sources is taxable whether you receive it while a nonresident

                                                or a tax treaty provision. Generally, tax treaty provisions apply only to the part
                                                of the year you were a nonresident and only if you are a resident for treaty purposes
                                                of a country that has a treaty with the United States.

                                             <p>The foreign tax credit is intended to relieve U.S. taxpayers of the double tax

                                                qualify for the foreign tax credit. You can choose to take the amount of any qualified

                                                claim credit without attaching Form 1116 if all of your foreign source income is passive

                                                To choose the deduction, you must itemize deductions on Schedule A, Form 1040.
