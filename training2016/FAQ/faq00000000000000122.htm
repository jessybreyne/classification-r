                                             <p>The maximum deductible interest on a qualified student loan is $2,500 per
                                                return. If you are a taxpayer whose return status is married filing jointly,
                                                you are allowed to deduct the full $2,500 only when your Modified Adjusted

                                                and $130,000, the amount of your student loan interest deduction is gradually
                                                reduced. The instructions for <a href="/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf"> Form 1040</a> (PDF) show
                                                you how to compute the deduction. If your MAGI is $130,000 or more, you are
                                                not able to take any deduction.

                                                widow(er), the full $2,500 deduction is allowed for MAGI levels equal to or
                                                below $50,000. For MAGI between $50,000 and $65,000, the deduction amount
                                                is phased out, and computation instructions are provided in the <a href="/pub/irs-pdf/i1040.pdf">

                                                there is no deduction.

                                                from the loans on our tax returns? Last year, I was not their dependent.</strong></span><p>
                                             <p>In order for a taxpayer to claim a deduction for student loan interest,
                                                the loan must be incurred for the taxpayer, the taxpayer' spouse, or a person
                                                who was the taxpayer's dependent when the taxpayer took out the loan. Since
                                                you were not your parents' dependent when they took out the student loan,
                                                the interest they paid on the loan does not qualify for deduction. However,
                                                the student loan interest payments you made on the student loan you took out
                                                on your behalf are eligible for deduction, provided all the other requirements
                                                are met. For more information, refer to <a href="/publications/p970/index.html">Publication 970</a>, <em>Tax Benefits
