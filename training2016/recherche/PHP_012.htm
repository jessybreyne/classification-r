  <H2>This is really FREE speech!</H2>
  <HR>

  <H3>Volume 3 #17 June 28, 2004 <BR>I am weary of news. That may sound like I'm 
  uninvolved. I'm not. I am over involved! We are all aware who ignited the 
  kindling to the most devastating Global forest fires. Mr. Bush, didn't anyone 
  warn you that it's dangerous for all of us when you play with matches? I need 
  some down time. A break in the shooting. I am proudly a M*A*S*H addict. For my 
  birthday, my little guy gave me three M*A*S*H T-shirts and two hats! I adore 
  M*A*S*H reruns. That may sound odd because it's about the Korean War. But its 
  main concern is the other side of war. It is about peace. Yeah, you watch 'em 
  twist Kleenex soaked in fake blood. Yeah, they are actors doing their 
  Hollywoodish jobs. Suspend disbelief. Too bad we can't do that in the all too 
  real world! M*A*S*H ran for eleven seasons and garnered one hundred and eleven 
  Emmy nominations. Didn't all you viewers get the message? I'm certain quite a 
  number of you did. It was a showcase for the result of wars. Patch them up. 
  Either send them home or back to the horrors that placed these victims in 
  their care and repair. That's what this world wide mess needs. Care and 
  repair. The problem is where to begin. This is a situation that would try even 
  the wisdom of Solomon. Fellow M*A*S*H addicts when going to the voting booths 
  for whom will you vote? Trapper, B.J., or the ever lovable Hawkeye? Heck! 
  Let's put Klinger in the top spot. He could be the main man and the best 
  dressed First Lady! </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><!-- BEGIN FORM SOURCE CODE -->
