          <TD class=contentbox>Last weekend I went sailing with Davina and a 
            handful of her friends from <A 
            href="http://www.cityofportmoody.com/default.htm" target=_blank>Port 
            Moody</A>. We stopped at <A 
            href="http://www.krispykreme.com/can.html" target=_blank>Krispy 
            Kreme</A> on the way which was a first for both Nicole and Michelle, 
            picking up doughnuts and <A 
            href="http://home.att.net/~bevebay2/Kremes.jpg" 
            target=_blank>sailing hats</A>. We met the others down at the 
            Marketplace in Point Roberts before heading to the <A 
            href="http://www.pointrobertsmarina.com/" target=_blank>marina</A> 
            and loading up the boat.<BR><BR>We sailed out from the marina, and 
            Lyle (the owner of the boat) asked if I wouldn't mind taking the 
            wheel. I happily obliged and we headed across the Strait of Georgia 
            about 10km towards <A href="http://www.saturnatourism.com/" 
            target=_blank>Saturna Island</A>. It was a beautiful day for 
            boating, unfortunately there was minimal wind, so we used the motor 
            most of the way across. Just before Saturna, there is a small marine 
            provincial park called <A 
            href="http://wlapwww.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/cabbage/photogal/images/cabbage_is_gal_r1_c5_f3.gif" 
            target=_blank>Cabbage Island</A> which was our final destination, so 
            we dropped anchor.<BR><BR>After taking a walk around the island and 
            most people having a quick swim, we went back to the boat for <A 
            href="http://www.gmodelo.com.mx/eng/marcas/negramodelo.html" 
            target=_blank>some beers</A> while the chicken cooked on the 
            barbecue. Michelle mentioned that she used to be a vegetarian, but 
            then one day she realized that she loved bacon and went from 
            vegetarian to <A 
            href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/16/health/main606710.shtml" 
            target=_blank>flexitarian</A>, I thought this was awesome because 
            you don't often hear about people converting back. But personally I 
            think it is a step in the right direction for her, because honestly, 
            who wants to share eating habits with <A 
            href="http://www.geocities.com/hitlerwasavegetarian" 
            target=_blank>Hitler</A>? *smirk*<BR><BR>Genocide... the vegetarians 
            choice.<BR><BR>After that we headed back towards the mainland, and 
            the wind picked up so we were able to sail for a while. On the whole 
            it was a really good day, many thanks to Roz for the invite and Lyle 
            for the use of his boat.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

            target=_blank>Marc Anthony</A>, <A 
            href="http://enrique.launch.yahoo.com/default.asp" 
            target=_blank>Enrique Iglesias</A> and <A 
            href="http://www.shakira.com/" target=_blank>Shakira</A>, Raul 
            decided to embark on a solo career. His technique was unbelievable, 
            making it sound like he had a full band with him... and on top of 
            this he's blind.<BR><BR>During the intermission, Davina and I went 
            downstairs (to mingle with the common folk *smirk*) and bought some 
            merch including Raul's live CD, which he signed for me. Then Mraz 
            came on and his set blew my mind... the guy sounds better live than 
            he does on his CD. He played a great length set, inviting both his 
            opening acts back on stage with him for his final two songs. His 
            dialogue between songs was fun, the way I remember <A 
            href="http://www.johnmayer.com/" target=_blank>John Mayer</A> being 
            when I saw him at Richard's on Richards.<BR><BR>After an exceptional 
            acapella version of "Curbside Prophet", Mraz came down to the front 
            of the stage and hung out with everyone, signing autographs and 
            getting pictures taken. Totally a class act in my opinion, and I 
            would see him again any time. Both Davina and I emailed Julie from 
            Ticketmaster thanking her for making it a truly memorable 
        evening.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

          <TD class=contentbox><B>***UPDATE***</B><BR><BR>I hadn't heard back 
            from anyone at either Ticketmaster or the House of Blues promotions 
            department today, so I called the Vice President of Ticketmaster 
            Canada, Julie Soares. She was very helpful, and told me I could 
            fax/email a copy of my complaint directly to her.<BR><BR>I sent the 
            same complaint that I posted here to her via both channels. Within 
            five minutes I got a call on my cell from Julie. She said that she 
            had spoken to the promoter and that they were going to allow us to 
            keep our original seats. It was as easy as that, and even 
            accomplished with a sweet tone care of 
            Julie.<BR><BR><B>***/UPDATE***</B><BR><BR>The <A 
            href="http://www.jasonmraz.com/" target=_blank>Jason Mraz</A> show 
            is tomorrow and I got Davina and I front row private balcony seats 
            for the show last month when they first went on sale. Today I got a 
            call from <A href="http://www.ticketmaster.ca/" 
            target=_blank>Ticketmaster</A> customer service informing me that 
            the promoter closed off all the balcony (including private) seats, 
            and that our seats would need to be reassigned. The day before the 
            fricking show they decide this, so I lost it on the Ticketmaster 
            customer service manager and filed the following complaint. I guess 
            the next step is going to the <A href="http://www.bbb.org/" 
            target=_blank>BBB</A>, luckily Ticketmaster is a registered company 
            with them so I'll hopefully get some compensation. *sigh*<BR><BR>
            <CENTER><IMG hspace=5 src="42_files/oldseats.gif" border=2><IMG 
            hspace=5 src="42_files/newseats.gif" border=2></CENTER><BR><BR>To 
            whom it may concern,<BR><BR>On May 6th, 2004, I purchased two front 
            row balcony seats (Section 1) to the Jason Mraz concert at the <A 
            href="http://www.centreinvancouver.com/" target=_blank>Centre for 
            the Performing Arts</A> in Vancouver, BC. I specifically chose these 
            seats because my girlfriend is 5.0" tall, and can not see the show 
            with taller people obstructing her view. At the time of my purchase, 
            I had the option to pick floor seats only a couple of rows back, 
            however for her benefit I picked the front row Dress Circle private 
            balcony directly over the stage. The concert was scheduled for June 
            10th, 2004, which happens to be tomorrow.<BR><BR>At 1:46PM this 
            afternoon (June 9th, 2004) I received a call from Veronica at 
            Ticketmaster Canada informing me that my tickets were no longer 
            valid because the Dress Circle and Balcony levels were being closed. 
            I was then told that I had to choose between either Row G (7 rows 
            back) on the right hand side, or Row O (15 rows back) if we wanted 
            to be in the center section. On top of this, I was told that there 
            would be no refunds regardless of whether we wanted to be 
            reseated.<BR><BR>I left a message for Elaine, the Customer Services 
            manager at Ticketmaster and when she finally called me back, she 
            simply reiterated what I had already been told. She told me that she 
            had spoken to many people about the changes, and that I was the only 
            one who had expressed frustration. In order for calls to be coming 
            through to the manager, I can't imagine that any of them were 
            positive.<BR><BR>I have been a long time Ticketmaster customer, and 
            to see this level of customer service both baffles and angers me. I 
            trusted that my purchase was secure and would be of the quality that 
            I envisioned. To receive a telephone call the day before the event, 
            TELLING me that I was being reseated with no option of a refund 
            despite my circumstances is totally unacceptable. On top of this, to 
            be seated behind people that purchased tickets after me, at a 
            vantage point that will hinder both my girlfriend and myself from 
            enjoying the show to the level that we would have in our expected 
            seats.<BR><BR>I trust that Ticketmaster and/or the promoter of the 
            show will take the appropriate steps to rectify this problem. I 
            expect to be contacted by telephone once an appropriate plan of 
            compensation has been established. As the concert is only 24 hours 
            away, I hope that we can come to a resolution before 
            then.<BR><BR>Drew Davies</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

            A very happy birthday to him, we had a really good time at the

          <TD class=contentbox>The other night I went to see <A 
            href="http://www.muse.mu/" target=_blank>Muse</A> at the <A 
            href="http://www.hob.com/venues/concerts/commodore" 
            target=_blank>Commodore</A> downtown. Originally the show was 
            scheduled to be played at <A 
            href="http://www.richardsonrichards.com/" target=_blank>Richard's on 
            Richards</A>, but they upgraded the venue and kept the original 
            price of... $12.50!<BR><BR>Naturally I couldn't believe this, as I 
            have paid more than this for cover to see my friends bands at local 
            pubs around town. $12.50 for the same band that will be headlining 
            the <A href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/" 
            target=_blank>Glastonbury Festival</A> in the UK this summer to over 
            100,000 people... bloody unbelievable.<BR><BR><IMG hspace=6 
            src="42_files/muse-setlist.jpg" align=left border=2>I went down with 
            my buddies Tim and Jay, and we met their cousins Brad and Jordan, 
            and their girlfriends in line. Unfortunately all of us had purchased 
            our tickets earlier except Tim who had just found out that day, so 
            he waited in the ticket line while we went inside. Even though the 
            show was technically sold out, they ended up letting enough of the 
            ticket lineup inside to include Tim.<BR><BR><A 
            href="http://www.southern.net/southern/band/EXIT0" target=_blank>The 
            Exit</A> opened and they had a pretty cool reggae-rock sound. I'm 
            not a huge fan of reggae which surprised me that I liked their set, 
            but overall they had a good sound. Near the end of their set we 
            moved up through the crowd, closer to the stage, and waited for Muse 
            to come on.<BR><BR>Once the show started, I maneuvered my way to the 
            front and had a great vantage point for the whole show. The boys 
            from Muse proceeded to put on one of the best shows I've ever seen 
            live. I love when a band can play as well or better than the tracks 
            on their CD's, and Muse is one of these bands. They were crazy tight 
            acoustically and their energy level was high, which led to the 
            entire drum set being trashed and Matt throwing down his <A 
            href="http://www.marshallamps.com/" target=_blank>Marshall</A> 
            cabinet and playing the last song standing atop of it.<BR><BR>In the 
            end I got myself a setlist as memento of a show, the likes of which 
            I'll probably never see again. It's like the time I saw <A 
            href="http://www.johnmayer.com/" target=_blank>John Mayer</A> at 
            Dick's on Dicks in front of less than 200 people. After the show, I 
            ran into <A href="http://imr.ca/photos/c/c.html" target=_blank>Ryan 
            and Andrew</A> from <A href="http://www.imr.ca/" target=_blank>in 
            medias res</A> and talked to them for a while before heading home 
            soaked and smiling.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

          <TD class=contentbox>In typical fashion, as soon as I started 
            updating the site again, it crashed on me. Not sure what caused it 
            to go down, but the important thing is that we're back in business. 
            One of the probable causes was that <A 
            href="http://www.blogger.com/" target=_blank>Blogger</A> completely 
            revamped their site/functionality. The new look is great, and I have

            target=_blank>Gmail</A> beta tester account. For those of you who

            <A href="http://www.hotmail.com/" target=_blank>Hotmail</A>. 
            However, instead of getting 2MB of space to store your messages like 
            on Hotmail, you get 1GB. That's right, 500x the size... all free. 
            Unfortunatly for the rest of you, it's only in beta testing phase so 
            you can't sign up just yet, but keep your eyes 
      open.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

          <TD class=contentbox>The drought has ended...<BR><BR>My sincere 
            apologies for the downtime over the last couple months, and the fact 
            that you had to see the hypnotizing rump shaking of William Hung 
            every time you visited the site. I hope to woo all of you back to 
            the longwinded stories that make up this simple life I lead. A big 
            thank you to all the people who encouraged me to get back into the 
            swing of things, and for putting up with my lack of updates... you 
            guys are radical.<BR><BR>I have many new life updates since I have 
            spoken to many of you, and I'll try to cover all of them over the 
            next couple weeks, so stay tuned... I'm not jerking your chain...

            civil engineering student from UC Berkeley. With the third round of 
            American Idol underway, William decided to follow his dreams to 
            become an entertainment phenom. His <A

            instead of becoming one of the countless other "no talent ass 
            clowns", he has become a pop culture icon. He has <A 
            href="http://www.williamhung.net/" target=_blank>fan sites</A> 
            popping up on the net, <A

            $25,000 and a recording contract with <A 
            href="http://www.kochentertainment.com/" target=_blank>Kosh 
            Entertainment</A>.<BR><BR>On top of this, he has even been 
            impersonated by <A

            remixes</A> of his performances than you could fit on a CD. Tim

          <TD class=contentbox>Here's a trip back... circa 1993 when the CBC 
            reported on this new thing called "<A 
            href="http://ms.radio-canada.ca/archives/English/computers19931008et1.wmv">Internet</A>".<BR><BR>...They're 
            sharing scientific data, arguing philosophy, or passing on cooking 
            tips and gossip. Night and day through a computer network called 
            "Internet".<BR><BR>...You need a computer and a phone, and suddenly 
            you're part of a new mesh of people, programs, archives, 
            ideas.<BR><BR>...There's an interesting sort of restraint that you 
            find, there's not a lot of cursing or swearing, there's not a lot of 
            personal cuts, there's not a lot of put downs that one would expect 
            to find... there's not screenfulls of "go to hell".<BR><BR>...The 
            thing that I am always left with when I leave, is this overwhelming 
            desire for people to be rooted. And the only way that they feel 
            rooted, is through another person. (My Australian friends should 
            love this one... its a minute and a bit in)<BR><BR>..."That's great" 
            reads the same as "That's great" on Internet.<BR><BR>...It has more 
            soul than any human being I know!<BR><BR>...The internet is growing 
            like an embryonic brain.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
