<H4>Introduction: Verification-Motivated Intelligence Modeling</H4>

My research interests center on models of intelligent behavior 
and the <em>descriptive</em> and <em>analytical</em> power of 
frameworks used to express those models. In particular, I study 
and design models that support application-specific 
<em>analysis</em> in addition to providing sufficient 
<em>description</em> of intelligent behavior. I frequently 
focus on models of intelligence that support the fine-grained 
analysis performed in mechanical verification (e.g., model 
checking, automated theorem proving). To restate this from a 
languages-oriented perspective: I focus on modeling-language 
frameworks for which the syntax supports a formal description 
of intelligent behavior <em>and</em> the semantics supports 
detailed analysis.


<!-- 
I take a language-oriented perspective. Using the word 
"language" somewhat loosely, every model of intelligent 
behavior is expressed in some language: predicate logic, 
state-transition systems, dynamical systems/differential 
equations, neural networks, English, or some other. Each has 
its natural emphases, strengths, and weaknesses.  For example, 
a control-theoretic approach (expressed using dynamical 
systems) might naturally emphasize the state-oriented evolution 
of the low-level dynamics of intelligence, but it might not 
easily support verification or proposition-level analysis. A 
planning-oriented AI approach (expressed using predicate logic) 
might naturally emphasize propositional properties relevant to 
high-level aspects of behavior, but it might obscure fine 
details of the dynamics.  An English description might 
effectively convey general principles in a way that is easily 
comprehensible to a wide audience, but it would likely be less 
than completely effective at formally specifying an implemented 
model. 
-->
 
<!--
<H4>Verifiable Dynamic Actors</H4>

<P>

-->

Motivated by animation, video game development, and robotics, we are 
developing models of autonomous intelligent actors 
(e.g., animated agents, navigating robots) that jointly satisfy 
three goals:

<ul>

<li> Models capture the low-level evolution of an actor's 
physical and cognitive states as it moves through its 
world.</li>

<li> Models can be designed in keeping with natural 
abstractions that designers wish to apply.</li>

<li> Models support automated assistance in verifying dynamic 
properties of these actors in dynamic worlds (e.g., with moving 
targets/goals and moving obstacles).</li> 

</ul>

<!--
Considering these three goals jointly, several previous 
modeling approaches do not meet these criteria. Some approaches 
do not effectively admit reasoning about dynamic worlds. Some 
logicist, AI-based approaches are far-removed from the 
low-level dynamics of motion or cognition. Purely 
dynamical-system-based approaches to navigation control often 
do not support natural (e.g., propositional) design-level 
abstractions and do not immediately admit mechanical assistance 
in analyzing models. 

<P>

In contrast, our approach is based upon the theoretical 
framework of <EM>hybrid dynamical systems</EM> (<EM>hybrid 
systems</EM>, for short), i.e., systems that combine continuous 
and discrete dynamics. Our initial explorations and past work 
in the field of hybrid systems suggest that it is a likely 
candidate for a framework to meet our goals. Hybrid 
system-based models allow access to low-level dynamics within a 
state-transition framework. Properties of the models may be 
formalized in expressive modal logic formulas for which there 
are established procedures for verification (model checking). 

-->

<!--
As applications grow progressively more sophisticated and complicated,
it becomes progressively more important that these goals be jointly met.

<P>
-->

Our modeling approach is based upon the theoretical framework 
of <EM>hybrid dynamical systems</EM> (<EM>hybrid systems</EM>, 
for short), i.e., systems that combine continuous and discrete 
dynamics. Hybrid system-based models allow access to low-level 
dynamics within a state-transition framework. Spatio-temporal 
properties of the models may be formalized in expressive modal 
logic formulas for which there are established procedures for 
verification (model checking). 

<!--
<H5> Navigation </H5>
-->

<P>

We began by making a concrete connection between hybrid system 
theory and animation: We directly applied the general-purpose 
hybrid system modeling tool <a 
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/mobies/charon/index.html">CHARON</a> 
to generate multi-agent animations with respect to 
well-understood theoretical system models. This was a novel,
systems-level understanding of navigation strategy for 
autonomous actors<!--. It was also a necessary preliminary for 
future work,--> and a proof of concept that the two disparate 
disciplines could be productively related. <!--For 
demonstrations, we generated animations similar to those  used 
to demonstrate the low-level, multi-agent navigation system of 
Goldenstein et. al.  in <CITE>Scalable Nonlinear Dynamical 
Systems for Agent Steering and Crowd Simulation</CITE>.-->

<P>

Motivated by the hybrid systems framework, we also designed and 
implemented a novel high-level navigation system in CHARON. In 
particular, our system guides the high-level behavior of actors 
moving through a virtual city. (We contrast global, high-level 
behavior with local, low-level behavior. For instance, avoiding 
immediate obstacles and other tasks on the order of local 
perception are low-level; street selection is high-level.) <!--This 
system has several desirable properties.--> Each actor has its own 
mental map and subjective perception of attributes of the world 
around it. Each actor makes its own navigation decisions in 
real time, based on the dynamically changing values of 
attributes in the world around it and <!--the dynamically changing 
weights it individually places on those attributes-->
its dynamically changing priorities. We coupled 
this high-level navigation system with the low-level system 
described above, creating a single hierarchical hybrid system 
for navigating intelligent virtual agents.


<!--

<P>

Our system demonstrates that hierarchical hybrid system 
models can provide a systematic, modular way to incorporate 
sophisticated low-level behavior into a design for higher-level 
behavioral and cognitive modeling. 
Agents' locomotive and cognitive behaviors are 
described in the same mathematical system. Both levels of 
behavior vary in real time as part of a coherent, integrated, 
hierarchical system.

-->

<P>

<!--
<H5> Verification </H5>
-->

We are also 
exploring ways to apply tools and methods for verifying hybrid 
systems to verify animation systems. In particular, having 
employed <em>approximation</em> and <em>abstraction</em> 
techniques to avoid decidability restrictions on our complex 
dynamical systems, we are creating a verifier (in MATLAB) that 
performs model-checking on reachability properties of our 
hybrid system models. With it, we can answer questions about 
areas such as: 

<ul> 

<li>Collision-avoidance of actors in 
dynamic worlds;</li> 

<li>Quantifiable relative difficulty of 
different worlds (with multiple metrics);</li> 

<li>Cinematographic constraints for animation.</li>

</ul>

I often consider this work from a languages-oriented 
perspective: We are utilizing hybrid system approximation and 
abstraction techniques to create a little language with a 
semantic structure that supports the above kinds of analysis. 
We are continuing to enrich our semantic tools and formalize 
the syntax of this language, to improve the tractability of 
verification and make the language more useful for 
designers of navigating actors, animations, and video games. Our
primary focus is on animations, but our work also has 
natural potential applications for robotics.

I am also currently involved in the cognitive modeling aspects 
of a multi-agent simulation of language evolution. Using the 
agent-based modeling tool <A href="www.swarm.org">SWARM</A>, we 
simulate the evolution of vowel harmony in a society of Turkic 
language speakers (a historically well documented phenomenon). 
Studying this particular feature may well prove useful in 
understanding more general elements of language change.

<H4>Cognitive Logical Inference and Student Modeling</H4>

Before turning my attention 
to intelligent virtual agents and animation systems, I 
developed formalized mathematical tactics for cognitive 
inference modeling. 
<!-- That research exercised my interests in 
applied logic and rigorous computational 
modeling of complex processes.
In fundamental ways, it required
the same skills as my current research: analyze a problem domain;
identify forms of inference relevant to that domain; and rigorously
formalize those inferences.-->

Like the Verifiable Dynamic Actors work, this is also 
Verification-Motivated Intelligence Modeling; this area, too, 
involves developing models of complex intelligent behavior in a 
framework that supports fine-grained, detailed analysis. Unlike 
the hybrid systems and model checking frameworks for Verifiable 
Dynamic Actors, however, these models utilize the highly 
rigorous methods of tactic-based automated theorem proving.

<P>

I concentrated in particular on developing a model of undergraduate
students carrying out logical proofs in a structured framework, but the
ideas underlying the work are not student-specific. The many facets of
this work are described in my dissertation,
<CITE>Tactic-Based Modeling of
Cognitive Inference on Logically Structured Notation</CITE>.
I have also written papers on its components, 
which range from logic and formalized mathematics 
(<CITE>Justifying calculational logic by a 
conventional metalinguistic semantics</CITE>) to 
cognitive science and eyetracking research 
(<CITE>Insight into theorem proving
via eye movements</CITE>). To conserve space 
here, I put <A href="diss_descr.html">a brief but 
significantly more descriptive introduction</A> to 
my dissertation research on a separate page.



<H4>Explanation</H4>

Related to all the research areas noted above, I am also 
interested in the phenomenon of <em>explanation</em>, 
effectively expressing and evaluating the results of analysis. 
Explanation has a particularly interesting connection to 
verification: The full depth and detail of verification may not 
be necessary for explaining the results of analysis to every 
possible audience, but a verification-oriented analysis 
provides a rich foundation for a range of possible 
explanations. 

<P>

Explanation is a high-level goal, built on top of the models of
intelligence. The Verifiable Dynamic Actors project is not yet able to
support explanation-oriented results, although that is an eventual
goal. In the Student Modeling work, there is a persistent concern with
explanation: We build up from simple axioms and rules to complex
tactics that capture how students explain their inference (in accord
with externally specified, normative standards).  <!--There is room for
further exploration along this dimension, although I am not currently
pursuing it.-->

<P> 

In addition, my paper <CITE>Frequency vs. probability 
formats: Framing the three doors problem</CITE> (<a 
href="#3doors">more description</a>) touches upon the topic in 
an experimental psychology context. It investigates how well 
people understand how they arrive at their answer when 
confronted with "The Monty Hall Problem."

<ul>
<li><b>Modal Logic Semantics</b><BR>
One way to avoid difficulties with partial functions is by 
employing the notion of <em>underspecification</em>. In modal 
logic S5 and some semantically related logics, 
underspecification preserves validity, so incorporating 
underspecification into their semantics does not change the 
classes of valid formulae. A formalization of 
underspecification and results for these modal logics are 
concisely presented in <CITE>Formal justification of 
underspecification for S5</CITE>. (co-author: David Gries)
