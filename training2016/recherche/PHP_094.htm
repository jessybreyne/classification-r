Thoughts </H2></CENTER></CENTER></CENTER>
<P><BR>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right 
one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be 
grateful for that gift. <BR><BR>When the door of happiness closes, another 
opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the 
one which has been opened for us. <BR><BR>The best kind of friend is the kind 
you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away 
feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. <BR><BR>It's true 
that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we 
don't know what we've been missing until it arrives. <BR><BR>Giving someone all 
your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in 
return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it 
grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like 
someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. 
<BR><BR>Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that 
fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to 
make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. 
<BR><BR>There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just 
want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! <BR><BR>Dream what you 
want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have 
only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. <BR><BR>May 
you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, 
enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. <BR><BR>Always 
put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts 
the other person, too. <BR><BR>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the 
best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their 
way. <BR><BR>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have 
searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance 
of people who have touched their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a 
kiss and ends with a tear. The brightest future will always be based on a 
forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past 
failures and heartaches. <BR><BR>When you were born, you were crying and 
everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the 
one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying. <BR><BR><I>Author

<P>People come into your life for a <B>REASON</B>, a <B>SEASON</B>, or a 
<B>LIFETIME</B>. When you know which one it is for a person, you will know what 
to do for that person. <BR><BR>When someone is in your life for a <B>REASON</B>, 
it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you 
through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you 
physically, emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a Godsend - and they 
are! They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any 
wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do 
something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes 
they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we 
must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is 
done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on. 
<BR><BR>Some people come into your life for a <B>SEASON</B> because your turn 
has come to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make 
you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give 
you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real ! But, only for a 
season. <BR><BR><B>LIFETIME</B> relationships teach you lifetime lessons - 
things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your 
job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to 
use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is 
blind, but friendship is clairvoyant. <BR><BR>Thank you for being a part of my 
life. <BR></P>
<HR>

<P>Dear God,<BR><BR>Please grant me the strength to carry on, and the patience 
to try again when things go wrong. Shine your guiding light on me to open my 
eyes when I can't see.<BR><BR>Please give me the ability to see beauty, where 
others see none. Allow me the hope of a new dream waiting to be dreamed, the 
chance to reach out and the wisdom to look forward to a new tomorrow. 
<BR><BR>Let me accept what I cannot change, and change all that's within my 
control. Teach me your ways as I walk through life, so I may learn and live it 
right<BR><BR>If granted these prayers, I promise to obey, and cherish your 
creations &amp; all that come my way. <BR><BR>Amen.<BR><BR>Faithfully 
yours,<BR>A Devoted Follower<BR><BR>

<H2>A Bit of Wisdom</H2>
<P><B>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front 
of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty 
mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the 
students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then 
picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar 
lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. The 
professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, 
the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The 
students responded with an unanimous "yes." The professor then produced two cans 
of beer from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, 
effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed. 
<BR><BR>"Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to 
recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important 
things—your family, your children, your health, your friends, your favorite 
passions—things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your 
life would still be full. "The pebbles are the other things that matter like 
your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else—the small stuff. "If 
you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the 
pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time 
and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are 
important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your 
happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your 
partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the 
house, and fix the disposal. "Take care of the golf balls first, the things that 
really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand." <BR><BR>One of the 
students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented. The professor 
smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full 
your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of beers." <BR><BR></B></P>
