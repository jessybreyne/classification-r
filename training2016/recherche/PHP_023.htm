<P></P>Hi! I'm Jeff Hibbard, and I work at <A 
href="http://www.bradley.edu/">Bradley University</A> in <A 
href="http://www.bradley.edu/itr/compserv/">Computing Services</A> (formerly 
known as <B>Information Management Services</B>, having been renamed to that 
from our <I>previous</I> name of <B>Computing Services</B>, before that being 
known as <B>The Computer Center</B> ... every management change soon leads to a 
name change). Want to know how long I've been <A 
href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/pics/misc/dilbert.htm">working here?</A> We could 
measure it by counting the number of reorganizations and job title changes I've 
been through, but that would take too long, so here are some other clues: 
<UL>
  <LI>When I first came to Bradley, the only way to interact with computers was 
  by punching little holes in <A 
  href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards">cards</A>. 
  <LI>When I first came to Bradley, students used <A 
  href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/srinst.htm">slide rules</A>, because portable 
  electronic calculators didn't exist yet. 
  <LI>I remember when I thought 300 bps modems were fast (That's 0.3K, for 
  newcomers who only know terminology like 14.4K and 28.8K). The standard used 
  to be 110 bps. 
  <LI>An unmarried, childless, normal-aged sophomore I got to know my first year 
  working here has a <B>daughter</B> who completed her 4-year degree at Bradley 
  a few years ago. 
  <LI>I remember when the people running this place conducted themselves in such 
  a manner that the local newspaper didn't write stories <A 
  href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/pjs/ernie.htm">like these</A>. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>I've collected quite a few pictures over the years of the staff and students 
I've worked with. <A href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/scripts/pictures.dll">Click 
here</A> to see some of them. </P>
<P>People with no window in their offices (or ex-Peorians who just miss the 
lovely Peoria weather) may <A 
href="http://uhura.bradley.edu/scripts/camera.dll">click here</A> for a 
real-time view out my office window. </P><IMG alt="[a really funny cartoon]"

vspace=5> 
<P>Here's some useless personal information, so I have an excuse to put in all 
these <A href="http://cegt201.bradley.edu/~dudeha/central.html">central 
Illinois</A> links. I was born <A 
href="http://www-lj.eb.com/cgi-bin/bio?month=7&amp;day=28">July 28</A>, 1953 
right here in <A 
href="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/illinois/peoria/">Peoria</A>, 
<A href="http://www.state.il.us/">Illinois</A>, but my family moved to <A 
href="http://www.outfitters.com/illinois/fulton/canton.html">Canton</A>, 
Illinois (about 30 miles away) when I was 5 years old. I graduated from <A 
href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/reunion.htm">high school</A> there, then came back 
to Peoria in the fall of 1971 as a <A href="http://www.bradley.edu/">Bradley 
University</A> student, and have been at Bradley in one form or another ever 
since, although I did commute from <A 
href="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/illinois/normal/">Normal</A>, 
Illinois for a couple of years. </P>
<P>I'm the faculty advisor for <A href="http://www.psiphi.org/">Psi Phi</A>, a 
Science Fiction organization at Bradley University. My job consists of signing a 
form once per year. Other than that, they take care of themselves. You should 
check out the impressive reference material that <A 
href="http://rhf.bradley.edu/~davidh/">David Henderson</A> maintains about "<A 
href="http://www.psiphi.org/DS9/">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</A>" and "<A 
href="http://www.psiphi.org/voy/">Star Trek: Voyager</A>" on the <A 
href="http://www.psiphi.org/">Psi Phi</A> web site, instead of doing his 
homework.</P>

alt="[picture of my wife]" hspace=10 src="edu_1_Jeff Hibbard_files/portrait.jpg" 
align=left border=0></A> On June 5, 1993 I married <A 
href="http://sophia.hibbard.net/">Tzonglee Wu</A>, who usually goes by Sophia 
around English-speaking people. She was born and raised in <A 
href="http://peacock.tnjc.edu.tw/ROC_info.html">Taiwan</A> and didn't come to 
the USA until her mid-twenties. Her father was originally from <A 
href="http://www.engin.swarthmore.edu/~he/shanghai/">Shanghai</A> in mainland <A 
href="http://fourier.bme.med.ualberta.ca/~fwang/prc.html">China</A>, but fled 
under gunfire around the time Chiang Kai-Shek lost China's civil war to the 
Communists in 1949. Her mother is native Taiwanese, raised during that period of 
<A href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3200/history.html">Taiwan's 
history</A> when it was occupied by Japan.</P>
<P>Here is a <A href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/geography.htm">map</A> for people 
who have no clue where Taiwan is.</P>
<P>Here's a <A href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/pics/sophia/red-wedding.htm">silly 
picture</A> of us we had taken in Taiwan, and a somewhat more <A 
href="http://jeff.hibbard.net/pics/sophia/flower-dress.htm">serious 
picture</A>.</P>
<P>Sophia wants me to tell everyone that she is now selling <A 
href="http://www.marykay.com/">Mary Kay</A> products. <A 
href="mailto:sophia@bradley.edu">E-mail her</A> for more information.</P>
<P>Her main job involves writing COBOL programs on IBM mainframes. Besides the 
modern view of computing this demonstrates, she is also the only person in my 
circle of friends who thinks <A href="http://meer.net/~mtoy/dan_quayle.html">Dan 
Quayle</A> did a good thing when <A 
href="http://www.xmission.com/~mwalker/DQ/quayle/qq/fam.values.html">he 
bashed</A> <A href="http://www.virtuallot.com/cmp/comedy/cm09.htm">Murphy

alt="[picture of my son]" src="edu_1_Jeff Hibbard_files/98.gif" width=159 
align=right border=0> </A>This is ironic, since my only son, and biggest source 
of joy in my life, <A href="http://chris.hibbard.net/">Chris Hibbard</A>, was 
born <A href="http://www-lj.eb.com/cgi-bin/bio?month=5&amp;day=26">May 26</A>, 
1988 to (using Mr. Quayle's words) an "unwed" "professional woman" (albeit one 
who works for the <A href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</A> 
rather than a television network). His mother and I cooperate very well in 
taking care of him, and he spends roughly half his time with me.</P>
<P>Here is some of his art work from the front of the refrigerator several years 
ago, and something else a bit more recent. <BR><IMG height=143 hspace=5

main hobby has become driving his parents crazy with loud, obnoxious noise that 
he seems to think is music. </P>
