<H3>About me</H3>

Institute of Technology (MIT)</A> with a Bachelor's of Science (SB) in <A

Previously, I had put the address <a href="mailto:aatm@dorm.mit.edu">aatm@dorm.mit.edu</a> 
due to worries of getting spam. However, I've gotten enough legitimate email addressed 
there, and didn't check it for nearly a year, causing problems. Therefore, I have decided 
to put my real email address here suitably obscured to prevent lazy spammers from stealing 
it. Not that it's of much use given the amount of spam I get every day. *sigh*
