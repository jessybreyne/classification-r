<FONT color=red><BR>Hi my name is Darren Furlong and this is my first effort at 
creating a Web page. Some of the pictures have links feel free to explore at 
your own discression I will try to update regulary<BR><BR>To start off with I 
would like to tell you a bit about myself. I live in a little village in Wexford 
called Kilmuckridge which is about 30 kilometres north of the town. I attended 
both primary and secondary school in Kilmuckridge. When I didnt get quite what I 
had hoped for in my leaving certificate I decided to do a P.L.C. cource in 
Enniscorthy a local town, this course could add up to 200 points onto my leaving 
cert so going to Waterford wasnt completely out of the question. The year came 
and went and I made some very good friends but unfortunately we have lost 
contact with each other. The Summer came and I continued to work in a local 
supermarket Pettitts at this stage I have been working there for the last two 
years. Im still there now but I am considering leaving as I am getting a little 
fed up with being treated like dirt. Anyway I was waiting for the results of the 
cource to come out but I didnt expect very much as I thought that I had failed 
three exams. I was at my girlfriends house when my friend Caitriona rang me 
asking how I had gotten on in my exams but I hadnt been. When I rang home my 
brother said that I had got Multimedia when he said that I went 
mental.<BR><BR>To tell you the truth I had put down Industrial Computing as my 
first choice but now Im glad that I didnt get it as Multimedia sounds like it 
could interest me moreso than Industrial. When I came to college at first I 
didnt know what to expect but the lecturers seemed pretty cool as are the people 
in my class and we are getting on really well so far.<BR><BR>My hobbies include
