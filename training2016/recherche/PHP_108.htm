<b><font size="+1">My main activities are work, 
<a href="http://www.pba.org/">bowling</a>, and racquetball.  
I was member of the <a href = "http://www.unl.edu/band/">Cornhusker 
Marching Band</a> for six years and am a BIG <a href = "husker/">Cornhusker 
football</a> fan.  I enjoy working with and learning about computers and 
watching Star Trek.  I also enjoy reading about unsolved mysteries such as 
JFK, the Bermuda Triangle, etc.</font></b><p>

<img src="Images/research.gif" width="291" height="67" alt="Research Interests"><P>

<b><font size="+1">My research interests are in mathematics and math education. 
I would like to find ways to adapt math-algebra programs, such as 
<a href="http://www.wolfram.com">Mathematica</a> and 
<A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.on.ca/">Maple</a>, for use in the 
math classroom.  I would also like to find ways to adapt the 
Internet for better use in education.  I would also like to 
continue to learn about HTML, CGI, Java, and anything else 
Internet related.  Be sure to check out my latest  
<a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~lcharbon/javascript.html">experiment</a> 
and my 
<a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~lcharbon/resume.html">Resum&eacute;</a>.
