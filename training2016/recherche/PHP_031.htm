<P>Hi! I'm Wendy Hines. I am an assistant professor of mathematics at UNL.
I began</P>

<P>here in Fall 1993. Before that, I received my PhD from Georgia Tech.</P>

<P>My research is in the area of dynamical systems. Currently I am working
on</P>

<P>discretized delay equations and continuity of attractors and Morse sets
with</P>

<P>respect to the disctretization timestep. This work is in my paper with
Tomas</P>

<P>Gedeon entitled Continuity of Morse Sets With Respect to the Discretization</P>

<P>Parameter.</P>

<P>This summer I am teaching a summer math camp for high school girls. </P>

<P>I'm teaching a course on Iterations of Functions. Soon we will be doing</P>

<P>stairstep diagrams to graphically show the orbit of an iterated function.</P>

<P>Here's an example.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We will also be doing bifurcation diagrams. Here's the bifurcation diagram
for</P>

<P>the logistic equation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You can find the notes for this in Iterations. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It's a great experience! It is not very often that a teacher gets to
teach 14 students who really </P>

<P>want to learn!
