<P>Hello. I'm an <I>n</I>th-year graduate student in <A 
href="http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/org/c/cheme/www/Titlepage.html">Chemical 
Engineering</A> at <A href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</A>. Since 6 September 
2000, <I>n</I> = 3; now that I have completed my <A 
href="http://www.mit.edu/people/aei/DeptSeminarAbstract.htm">departmental 
seminar</A>, I am at the midpoint of my graduate career, which means I should be 
focusing on selecting the problems that will form the core of my thesis and 
start worrying about finding a job in the midst of an economic downturn. In 
addition, I am also learning far more about theoretical physics and mathematics 
than is probably healthy for a chemical engineer. [Now that I'm also a <A 
href="http://www.krellinst.org/CSGF/">DOE fellow</A>, I'll have to add computer 
science to that list.] For those few brave souls who may actually be interested 
in knowing what I do for a living (for the moment, at any rate), I now have a <A 
href="http://www.mit.edu/people/aei/research.html">research description</A> 
available for viewing, as my thesis proposal has been submitted. 
<P>In the department, I'm currently involved with the <A 
href="http://www.mit.edu/visit-x/index.html">Graduate Advisory Committee</A>, a 
group which was originally responsible for addressing graduate student concerns 
to the department's Visiting Committee (an oversight board), and has since 
evolved into a quasi-permanent committee open to all graduate students who are 
interested in improving the "quality of life" in the department. 
<P>In my spare time, I've been involved with several choruses, both in and 
outside of MIT. [Yes, people <I>do</I> have existences outside of their research 
at MIT.] During the academic year, I sing with either the MIT <A 
href="http://web.mit.edu/21m.405/www/">Chamber Chorus</A> or the MIT <A 
href="http://web.mit.edu/21m401/www/">Concert Choir</A>, depending on their 
repertoire and my schedule. This summer I participated in the inaugural season 
of <I>Senza Misura</I>, a 20-voice chamber chorus, playing in all three groups 
the challenging yet rewarding role of baritone in tenor II's clothing (a role I 
have heard described most vividly, and aptly, as ''tenor subwoofer''). [''I'm 
not a tenor, but I play one on stage. . . .''] 
<P>During Fall 1999, I was a member of both the Chamber Chorus and Concert 
Choir, singing Britten, Carter, and Purcell with the former, and Mozart, 
Poulenc, and Verdi with the latter. In Spring 2000, I sang with the Concert 
Choir, singing Persichetti's Cantata No. 3, <I>Celebrations</I> in March, and 
Hindemith's <I>Apparebit repentina dies</I> in April, along with Bruckner motets 
and his <I>Mass in E minor</I>--a once-in-a-lifetime experience, in many ways. 
For Fall 2000, we'll be singing Bach, Schubert, Bernstein, Copland, and 
Beethoven. 
<P>More recently, I took part in the premiere of a piece written in memory of 
John Corley, band director at MIT for many years. The piece, Michael Weinstein's 
<I>Roman Odes</I>, cannot really be considered a favorite of mine--too many 
strange and bizarre goings-on, including the music that didn't arrive until 
<I>three days before the premiere</I>! To give you an idea of the absurdities of 
the piece, it has spawned not one, but <I>two</I> entries in my <A 
href="http://www.mit.edu/people/aei/ChoralDictionary.html">MIT Supplement to the 
Choral Dictionary</A>: check out the entries <I>"Dee-whah?"</I> and "PVC pipe." 
<P>I was an undergraduate at <A 
href="http://www.mit.edu/people/aei/www.yale.edu/yaleinfo">Yale University</A>, 
from which I graduated in May 1998. I studied Chemical Engineering there, too, 
along with a wonderful group of conspirators collectively known as <I>YChE</I> : 
<A href="http://www.princeton.edu/~adelizzi">Eric Adelizzi</A>, Jennifer 
Jackson, Mike Janik, Mai Nguyen, and Jeff Shih. [Don't ask me to expand the 
acronym--it's not as straightforward as it looks, and I couldn't remember it all 
if I tried. <A href="mailto:adelizzi@princeton.edu">Ask</A> Mr. Adelizzi if you 
think you really must know.] 
<P>For those people who mistakenly ended up here instead of my brother's web 
page, I suggest trying <A href="http://mail.med.upenn.edu/~samer/tc">his</A> 
site at Penn. <I>Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. . . .</I>
