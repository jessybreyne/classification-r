   <P>Yes, you've arrived at yet another of the millions of personal websites that clutter up the
      internet these days. This one just covers me and my life so if you have arrived here because I used the words
      "sex", "girls", "free" and "naked" in this sentence, you're going to be very disappointed.</P>

   <P>If you are a friend of mine, please click on every link you see to boost the hit rate and
      make me feel justified in wasting my time writing this. If not, feel free to leave before you fall asleep.</P>

   <P>This website has been completely re-written recently, partly to re-organise the sections, partly to remove
      the frames which caused problems for all the people that didn't come in at the front page, and partly to show
      off with CSS. The new design is pure CSS so it works well in any CSS compliant browser which includes
      Netscape, Opera, and (my personal favourite) Mozilla. Of course, Microsoft Internet Explorer doesn't handle
      the CSS standards properly so the site won't look exactly the way it's supposed to in MS IE. Older browsers
      which don't handle CSS properly will show the content, but the navigation bars down the side won't work,
      instead the navigation text appears at the top of the page so it can still be used, even though it looks
      crap. There's bound to be a few mistakes here and there so please
      <A HREF="mailto:website@douglasyates.net?subject=I've found a bug.">let me know</A> if you find one.</P>

   <P>If you have an older browser and are wondering what you are missing, I suggest you go to
      <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/" TARGET=_blank>Mozilla</A> and get a copy of the browser. It is perfectly
      CSS compliant, has no adverts, and has some wonderful features to safeguard security unlike the browser from
      a certain large American software company.</P>
