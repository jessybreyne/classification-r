        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hi, 
          My name is John Yap. I have done a home page here previously at this 
          url but seriously I think the previous page s***ed big time. Having 
          graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic last year, I am currently working 
          in National University of Singapore, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. 
          Dwelling in the Centre for IT and Applications at the Dean's office, 
          I am one of the webmasters who design web sites for the various departments 
          and produces multimedia educational development courseware/software 
          for academic purposes.&nbsp;I am all ready to take on the web challenge 
          on a wider scale.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
          I seriously hate talking about myself. I would rather let the music 
          I listen to speak for me. Dun worry, I do not condemn any form of music 
          here because personally I think it is a way people communicate their 
          life, style, feelings, thoughts et al to other people. So even if it 
          is crappy music on the radio, I dun really give a damn about it. Pretentious? 
          Think what you want. So long as it doesn't impinge on my physical life 
          here, you can say or do what you want. </font></p>

          artistes I featured here are but a small portion of what I hear. They 
          were chosen not because of I love them that much but for reasons that 
          I think they deserve the necessary attention from people visiting the 
          site and that they are just not given the exposure they need to make 
          future records. So guys, Keep Shining! <a href="menu.htm" target="_top">&gt;&gt; 
          Now on to the big showcase for you guys!</a> </font></p>
