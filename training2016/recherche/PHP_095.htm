I will be on leave for the fall semester.

<H2><a HREF="http://www.math.unl.edu/~adonsig/research.html">Research</a></H2>

My research interests are in operator algebra and operator theory.
In particular, most of my papers are about limit algebras, infinite-dimensional
operator algebras that are limits of finite-dimensional algebras. 
In spite of being "almost finite-dimensional", they have some quite suprising
properties.<p>

I've put more information, including abstracts of my papers, on a separate
<a HREF="http://www.math.unl.edu/~adonsig/research.html">page.</a><p>

There is a local semi-annual conference in functional analysis,
<a HREF="NIFAS.html">the Nebraska-Iowa Functional Analysis Seminar</a>
which I help arrange.<p>

Jointly with <a HREF="http://www.math.ucalgary.ca/~mikel/"> Michael 
Lamoureux</a> of the University of Calgary, I organized a workshop on 
<a HREF="http://www.pims.math.ca/birs/workshops/2003/03w5110/">
Coordinate Methods in Nonselfadjoint Operator Algebras</a> in
December of 2003 at the

Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery</a>.<p>

<H3> <a name="rara"> Real Analysis with Real Applications </a> </H3>

<center><img src="http://vig.prenhall.com/coverimage/0130416479.jpg" border=1 hspace=150 vspace=0 alt="book cover"></center>

<p>Together with <A HREF="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~krdavids">Kenneth R. Davidson 
</a> of the University of Waterloo, I have written an introductory analysis textbook, 
called <I>Real Analysis with Real Applications</I>.
The publisher, Prentice Hall, has a 
<A HREF="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0130416479,00.html">
webpage for the book</a>.<p>

There is a pdf file available 
<A HREF="http://www.math.unl.edu/~adonsig/RARA.pdf">here</a>
containing the table of contents and the preface for the book.<p>

The second printing of the book is scheduled for January of 2004.
We have <A HREF="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~krdavids/realerrata.html">
two lists of errata</a>, the first for errors found since the second printing
and the second for errors fixed in the second printing.<p>

Feel free to email us with comments on the book.<p>

<HR>

<H3> <a name="pme"> Pi Mu Epsilon </H3>

I am faculty advisor for the <a HREF="http://www.math.unl.edu/~pme">Nebraska Alpha</a>
chapter of <a HREF="http://www.pme-math.org">Pi Mu Epsilon</a>, a national 
honorary society dedicated to mathematics.

<HR>

<H3> <a name="opalgsem"> Operator Algebras Seminar </H3>

I am organizer for the Operator Algebras Seminar, which meets
on Wednesdays at 2:30 in Oldfather 827.
I send out emails giving advance announcements of the seminar;
if you want to recieve these emails, let me know (ideally, by email).

<HR>

<H3> <a name="tex"> TeX, LaTeX, and AMS-LaTeX </H3>

These are typesetting programs that are defacto standards for
mathematics and physics papers.  

The hardest part of getting started with them is finding 
good model documents to modify.
In the absence of <I>good</I> models, I offer a few documents of
my own, listed
<A HREF="http://www.math.unl.edu/~adonsig/tex/">here</A>,
including a documentclass file for unl theses, <i>unlthesis.cls</i>,
and short sample thesis using this class file. <p>

There are a multitude of good sites on TeX.  
I would particularly recommend the
<A HREF="http://ctan.org/">Comprehensive TeX Archive Network</A> 
and the American Mathematical Society's page on 
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/tex/">TeX Resources</A>. <p>

There are two books I would particularly recommend:
<UL>
<LI> <I> LaTeX: A Document Preparation System </I> by Leslie Lamport,
	Second Edition, Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 0-201-52983-1.
<LI> <I> A Guide to LaTeX 2e </I> by Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly,
	Second Edition, Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 0-201-42777-X.
</UL>
The first is the original user's manual by the author of LaTeX.
