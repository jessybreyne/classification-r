<P>My name is Helena <A HREF="name.html">Heung-Wah</A> Yan. I was born
in <A HREF="http://www.hongkong.org/">Hong Kong</A> in 1972, but my
family moved to <A HREF="http://www.ci.sf.ca.us/">San Francisco</A> in
1984. I have lived in the Bay Area since. </P>

<P>I graduated from <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</A>
in 1994 with a B.S. in <A HREF="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/">Computer
Science</A>, and I joined <A HREF="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle
Corporation</A> immediately afterwards. I was working in the
<A HREF="http://www.oracle.com/ibm/">Power Products Division</A> for
2 1/2 years, then I transferred to
<A HREF="http://www.oracle.com/ebusiness/crm_service.html">Front
Office Applications</A>. Two years after that, I left Oracle and joined
<A HREF="http://www.siebel.com/">Siebel Systems, Inc.</A> Here is my
<A HREF="resume.html">résumé</A>.

<P>Ever since high school when I read about the establishment of the
<A HREF="http://www-osp.stanford.edu/Kyoto/SCTIHomepg.html">SCTI</A>
(Stanford Center for Technology & Innovation) program, I had wanted to
attend Stanford Univerity. Well, turned out I enrolled in the program
in 1993, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. The
academic quarter in Kyoto was memorable, thanks to my host family. The
internship program at <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A> (Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone) was especially worthwhile, since I was
finally forced to speak and hear Japanese around the clock. I have
also learned to read Japanese technical manuals, which really is not
that bad after you get used to seeing katakana. </P>

<P>One hobby that I developed in Japan was listening to Japanese pop
music. My favorite band back then was <A HREF="wands/">WANDS</A>, but
<I>W</I> (Wesugi Show) and <I>S</I> (Shibasaki Hiroshi) have left the
band and formed a new band called <A HREF="alnico/">al.ni.co</A>. I've
also come to like visual rock, thanks to Mark. My favorite bands
include LUNA SEA, L'Arc~en~Ciel and MALICE MIZER. Another hobby is watching
<A HREF="http://www.halfaya.org/dorama/">Japanese TV Drama</A>. I was
interested in learning about Japanese encoding methods for a while, so
I bought and started reading Ken Lunde's
<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/catalog/ujip/">Understanding Japanese
Information Processing</A>, no doubt one of the best references. (I
never quite finished reading the book though...) </P>
