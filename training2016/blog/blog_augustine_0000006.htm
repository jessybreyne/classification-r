  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Here's another sketch wot I 
    did earlier and a couple more photos so you can feel the atmosphere of that 
    vibrant Sunday afternoon in Trafalgar Square.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Kids and parents happily drawing 
    but the Dad in orange has had enough. Top left corner is a bit of the stage 
    where eventually the giant <i><font color="#FFCC99">Hay Wain</font></i><font color="#99CCFF">-by-numbers</font> 
    was installed. In the centre is the National Gallery, sporting a banner: <i><font color="#FFCC99">Art 
    on the Square, join the party</font>.</i> On the far right is a Persil (the 
    soap people) tent - they were one of the sponsors and supplied free art materials 
    (more clothes to be dirtied then washed whiter than white). Don't be cynical, 
    it was nice of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> The bloke who has flung himself 
    down in gay abandon is one of many who accepted the challenge to lie down 
    on a long roll of paper so that people could draw around them then fill in 
    the outlines. A lady advances, pencil in hand, about to possess him.<br>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99"> THE BIG DRAW</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><img src="blogimages/scarfe-by-me.jpg" width="332" height="450" align="left" name="scarfe-by-me.jpg" alt="Scarfe drawn drawing">Wonderful 
    day yesterday in Trafalgar Square. The <font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.drawingpower.org.uk/menu2.htm" target="_blank">Big 
    Draw</a> <font color="#99CCFF">event took place and I was there along with 
    hundreds of people all raring to have a go at drawing. What started out a 
    few years ago as a tentative initiative is now an annual event everywhere 
    in the U.K. and yesterday it took over Trafalgar Square. Tents all over the 
    place in which children and adults were given art materials and challenged 
    by a huge variety of creative projects.</font></font></font> <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Best 
    of all, from my point of view, was the space where some of my cartoonist heroes 
    took turns drawing on a paper wall. I did a quick sketch of the great <font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.geraldscarfe.com/" target="_blank">Gerald 
    Scarfe</a></font> then boldly asked him to autograph it, which he did with 
    the immortal words: <font color="#FFCC99"><i>&quot;This is me&quot;</i></font>. 
    The proof is on the left. He also said <i><font color="#FFCC99">&quot;It's 
    very good. I need to get a haircut&quot;</font></i>. I am chuff chuff chuffed. 
    Below is Scarfe in the flesh, not at all fierce like his drawings but no doubt 
    the avuncular appearance is deceptive. Later there was <font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.lambiek.net/rowson_martin.htm" target="_blank">Martin 
    Rowson</a></font><a href="http://www.lambiek.net/rowson_martin.htm"> </a>(below 
    right) another of my favourite political cartoonists, and the endearingly 
    quirky <font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.stevenappleby.com/" target="_blank">Steven 
    Appleby</a></font> whose photo I didn't get, alas. There was so much to do 
    and see, I wanted to be everywhere at once. </font></p>

    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Dominating the square 
    was a giant stage with a backdrop of numbered rectangles which, at 7 pm, would 
    be filled with a re-creation of Constable's <i><font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/C/constable/constable15.html" target="_blank">The 
    Hay Wain</a></font>,</i> in sections painted by 150 artists under the direction 
    of the ubiquitous Australian Rolf Harris. There was a lot of loudspeaker hoopla 
    about this cleverness but it wasn't really my scene so I moved on into the 
    National Gallery where the atmosphere was electric and eclectic. Workshops 
    had been held throughout the day and there was a sense of ease and freedom 
    not usually associated with the great museums. I sat in front of <font color="#FFCC99"><i><a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG1325" target="_blank">Allegory 
    of Love III</a></i><font color="#99CCFF"> by Veronese (circa 1528-1588) and 
    did this drawing.</font></font></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><br>
    <br>
    <img src="blogimages/allegory.jpg" width="400" height="304" vspace="4" name="allegory.jpg" align="left" alt="After Veronese"> 
    I'd forgotten how enjoyable it is to draw from works of art, Now I've tasted 
    it again, I'm coming back. Maybe even once a week. It's so exciting to choose 
    some masterwork and dive into it as if into a swimming pool, paddling around 
    in its ambiance, making it your own. I have no idea what's going on in this 
    painting, it's totally absurd, but I like the shapes. What is the big bloke 
    saying? &quot;Are you going to spend the whole day in bed or what?&quot;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99">GLOBAL DARKENING?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><img src="blogimages/powercut.jpg" width="300" height="334" align="left" name="powercut.jpg">Last 
    night as I sat typing an email everything suddenly went dark. No, it wasn't 
    darkness in my head but in the whole house. I looked out the window and there 
    was darkness in the whole neighbourhood as far as the eye couldn't see. A 
    power cut, a major major power cut, the second one in recent weeks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Felt my way to the kitchen, 
    located a couple of candles in a drawer, lit them and put them on the windowsill. 
    People were doing the same thing in other houses and in the pub across the 
    street. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">The warm glow 
    of candlelight and the sense of going back in time to pre-industrial days 
    could not wipe out the panic I felt, almost like a bereavement. Not for the 
    loss of my fridge, central heating, hot water, washing machine, dishwasher, 
    CD player, fax machine, radio, television, toaster, food blender, hairdryer, 
    vacuum cleaner.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> But my computer! Light of 
    my life, home of my blog, home of my friends' blogs, window to the world, 
    essential tool for my current artwork, extra limb I cannot do without now 
    that I have come to depend on it. What if it was all gone? What if I could 
    no longer talk to you and read you and be part of this cocoon of cyber friendship 
    all of us have created? What if power cuts become the norm, getting longer 
    and longer, finally abandoning us entirely to the dark and cold and our own 
    out-of-practice resourcefulness? Yes I know it would serve us right for our 
    wastefulness and greed and selfishness and indifference to the lives of millions 
    of people on this planet who have never enjoyed what we take for granted. 
    But how would we cope with it?<br>

    an hour. Last time it was gone for only fifteen minutes. I'm starting to draw

    instead. Since I was given no time at all to impress Dem I just did a little 
    dance to that Leo Sayer 45 rpm again. The day went all too fast and we said 
    farewell in the tube, Dem to see friends in Kent and I to the BookArts Bookshop

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><img src="blogimages/footaccident.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="left" name="footaccident.jpg">Out 
    to dinner with friends last night at a Greek restaurant, we were waiting for 
    a table when a stack of plates piled on a shelf adjoining my elbow suddenly 
    crashed to the ground, most of them on top of my Birkenstock sandalled left 
    toe. I may or may not have been responsible for the crash but in any case, 
    crockery was smashed. My toenail too, not quite smashed but spouting blood. 
    Now here's the meaningful part:<br>
    <br>
    What did the Greek restaurant owner do? Berate me for clumsiness? Present 
    a bill for smashed china? Call an ambulance? Wring his hands and tear his 
    hair? None of those. He fetched a bottle of his best whisky and poured a generous 
    amount on my toe. Then he offered me a stiff brandy (to drink). When I asked 
    for a piece of garlic - my favourite antiseptic and blood stopper - did he 
    laugh or raise a skeptical eyebrow? Not at all. The garlic was immediately 
    brought and I applied it contentedly to my drunken toe which of course instantly 
    stopped bleeding. We were then given a table and various goodies on the house. 
    An excellent evening was had by all.</font></p>

    and patriotism would be abolished. Instead there would be universal respect 
    and enjoyment of every culture's individuality, their different ways of thinking 
    and behaving, their unique approach to life. There would be no flag-waving 
    fanaticism, no &quot;my country right or wrong&quot;. All the different cultures 
    of different places on the planet would meet in sport and arts and educational 
    events and in joint projects for the betterment of the quality of life for 
    all.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> <img src="blogimages/balance.jpg" width="190" height="350" align="left" name="balance.jpg">Since 
    nobody offered an answer to the question or expressed any interest whatsoever 
    (sob) in my predicament, I am now forced to explain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> The incident which I described 
    below in mind-numbing detail took place at a Neurological Hospital in London 
    last week. I was referred there by my GP after a couple of spells of scary 
    dizziness compelled me to overcome my natural aversion to going anywhere near 
    medical premises. It's not that I have anything against doctors as such - 
    most of the thankfully small number I have personally needed to consult in 
    my life have been perfectly acceptable. It's just that the whole medical edifice 
    seems to me full of cracks and cobwebs. No, I won't rant on this subject. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">The <s>torture</s> tests I 
    endured were in aid of determining whether my hearing and balance bits are 
    doing their job. Apparently, they are - or at least they were until the tests. 
    The end result is the same as it was before the torture - i.e. nobody knows 
    why my dizzy spells occurred: &quot; <i>It could be anything </i>&quot;. The 
    good news is:<br>
    &quot; <i>Your blood pressure is that of a teenager </i>&quot;.</font></p>

    TORTURE TALE TOOK PLACE AND WHY?<br>
    <font color="#99CCFF">(Answers in Comments, please)</font></font></p>
  <p><img src="blogimages/whereami.jpg" width="237" height="300" name="whereami.jpg" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">You 
    are strapped into a large armchair which sits on a raised platform inside 
    a kind of canvas tent. Electrodes are attached to the corners of your eyes 
    and forehead after vigorous rubbing of your skin with a gritty substance. 
    This is carried out by soft spoken, cheerful attendants. You are instructed 
    to sit still and keep your eyes focused on a tiny light which will appear 
    in front of you when the curtain is drawn.<br>
    <br>
    The striped shower curtain thing is then pulled shut and darkness surrounds 
    you, total absolute coal black darkness. A red dot of light then starts hopping 
    around in front of you - left, right centre, slow, fast, fast, slow, slow.<br>
    The jovial voice beyond the shower curtain commands you not to move your head, 
    keep staring at the light.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> After an indeterminate period 
    of dot-hopping, the chair in which you sit starts spinning to the right. The 
    voice tells you this is happening but you can't hear. You now understand why 
    they strapped you to the chair: it's to stop you from running out of the building 
    screaming. You are totally disorientated but are told to keep focusing on 
    the red dot, then at the spot vacated by the red dot when it's switched off. 
    The chair now begins spinning to the left. You try to remember tricks the 
    heroes of spy movies use to prevent being brainwashed but your brain has successfully 
    been washed squeaky blank.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">The 
    lights are turned on and you sit obediently waiting to be told what to do 
    next. The shower curtain now begins to spin round and you realise the purpose 
    of the black stripes: they are there so that you must stare at them as they 
    whirl around you, thus polishing off whatever's left of your reason. This 
    goes on for, oh, some time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Then suddenly it's over and 
    the charming attendants are unstrapping you and leading you into another room 
    where a new, equally charming attendant invites you to lie down. You offer 
    no resistance as he places a tray under your left ear and squirts a vast amount 
    of cold water into it. He too tells you to stare at a red dot on the ceiling 
    and asks, &quot; Are you dizzy yet?&quot; In fact you are sickeningly dizzy 
    and the dot is swinging out of control. Satisfied, the attendant repeats the 
    cold water process in your right ear and observes you intently as your eyes 
    lurch nauseously all over the ceiling in the opposite direction. He leaves 
    the room, telling you to have a little rest. When he returns, it is with very 
    hot water to squirt in both ears, one at a time. The dizziness is even worse 
    but apparently this is the desired result. You are too blanked out to see 
    if the attendant is taking notes. Thus ends this report.</font></p>
