	 Day 7 at the School of Hard Knocks
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      The last thing I thought of before I fell to sleep last night, was the first thing I thought of when I awoke (albeit bleary-eyed and full of Tequila). What on earth am I doing with <em>two</em> men in my life. For a short while I contemplated whether I should explain tonights plans to Mr Blue, for security reasons.  Seconds later an inner voice told me that wasn't a wise idea.(Instinct again?) I'm not sure how Mr Blue feels about me, and I honestly didn't expect Sunday night to happen the way it did.<br /><br />I have been feeling quite lonely lately, which under the circumstances should be expected.<br /><br />Luckily Mr Blue has warned me that he is working overtime tonight, so there is not any awkward explaining to do.  I wouldn't call this lying, I just haven't said anything.  In my eyes that makes a big difference.  Anyway, it's not as if tonight is going to be a serious date.  I'm only really doing it to wind up Ms White, and as it seems to be working I might as well have fun while I'm doing it!<br /><br />Well, despite my keeness for the day to pass as quickly and painlessly as possible, it's been an interesting and productive day at school. <br /><br />Whilst counting down the hours here's what I got up to today.  <br /><br />1. Dinner time, I rang Mr Blonde from the school office phone, checking he was still on for tonight.<br /><br />2. The Man from Delmonte, he say YES!<br /><br />3. Better still it was great rubbing Ms White's nose in it, as she stood by listening in to my well rehearsed telephone conversation. I made sure I spoke loud and clear!<br /><br />4. This time it was my turn to smile all day.<br /><br />5. Nothing Ms White did today was able to change my brilliant mood. You should see the list of duties she gave me when I walked in this morning. Half of them include stuff that isin't relevant to my job description, such as being the co-ordinator of the washing up rota, which everyone HATES and standing out in the freezing cold on playground duty, during my coffee break when it's 'Tank's' turn to be playground monitor. He plays by his own rules and woebetide anyone who gets in his way.  Talk about setting me up to fail. <br /><br />6. Spent twenty minutes of the afternoon sitting in the visitors room, nextdoor to the Head Teach's office tyring to pursuade 'Tank Boy!' to do his spelling test.That was, until I hit upon a lightbulb of an idea. <br /><br />7. Five minutes after that he was sitting back in class attempting the test and no longer trying to cause the rest of the class any disturbance. <br /> <br />8. A crowd of stunned, gobsmacked faces filled the classroom.They just couldn't understand how I had tamed the wild beast, and perhaps they never will.<br /><br />9. An unopened packet of custard creams makes the perfect bribe.It doesn't take an Einstein to work out the mind of a delinquent child. He just needs that 'little extra' to help him make those all too vital descisions in his mixed up life. His biscuits may not last the whole week, but 'Tank' has promised he'll be good 'until Friday'. We'll have to wait and see on that one.  <br /><br />10. Went home on a high after being hailed the 'Miracle Worker!'<br /><br />Mr Green was particularly impressed with my performance and asked me if I would be interested in taking the higher level teaching assistant course.  I said I would definitely think about it.  Who knows what the future may hold. But for now, I live in the present.  That being, what to wear tonight.  I think it's time to get out my pink suit.  You know, the one I wore for the interview.  It may just bring me luck again.<br /><br />Will it? You'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out! <br /><br />For now, I'm signing off.  Got to finish getting myself 'all spruced up' as my dad used to say.   We're meeting at nine, in The White Horse down the road. <br /><br />Wish me luck!<br /><br /><br /><br />* Site of the day - <a href="http://www.links2love.com/dating_first_date.htm"target=_"blank">First Date </a>Bible. <a href="http://www.links2love.com/teens_kissing.htm" target=_"blank">Kissing Tips </a>(OK this is more than one site, but I thought it necessary!

Then check out my new side column, especially planned for those who have something to hide.  Here's a little taster...</span><br /><br />Please forgive me for sounding a bit dizzy this evening.  Yesterday I spent ages on the computer, updating my site-------------> (Look to your right!)<br /><br />I've got the bags under my eyes to prove it. There's also a distinct lack of caffeine in the house.<br /><br />I found the above site yesterday as I was searching for 'self help' sites for those with indentity problems, like me.  You'd be surprised what you can find!<br /><br />Some top tips for anyone who, as in my position, needs to lie a lot!  I've met one of the writers who used to work for the CIA, (induction training) so they know what they are talking about.  Whether you believe them, is another story!<br /><br />Anyway, with my homework complete I turned on the telly, only to watch a programme about how to cheat <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4169313.stm" target=_"blank">the Lie Detector.</a>I'd love to take the test, as an experiment, to see if I have it all under control.  Could they tell when I lied if my brain was telling me I wasn't? <br /><br />With Ms White (aka the office b&w cow) on the 'smiley' warpath, I decided it was high time to do a little 'identity research'. Making sure I knew my background story, memorising my well thought out 'where I came from'and 'where I worked previously' etc.  It pays to be on top form when your dealing with the public eye.  I need to act confident in everything I do, as to not arouse suspicion. It's all in the details, as the above website will confirm. <br /><br />I also had a long, long chat with Mr Blue, yesterday.  Being so busy surfing etc I never even left the house all weekend.  In turn this also meant I forgot to 'sign in' at the local police station. I've only failed to report in once before and it didn't take long for Janine (the switchboard operator) to call me to check everything was ok.  When I told Mr Blue how Janine hadn't rung to remind me he told me it was alright, as long as I was 'seen' by him, he'd report back. In fact, according to him, I do not have to check in anymore.  Apparently, I am no longer on the 'A List' (those in most danger).  Now I have a job and have settled down in my new life they seem to have lost interest in me.  Which is a bit worrying.  In my eyes nothing has changed.  I'm <em>still</em> the same person inside.  My parents are not coming back and my life is <em>still</em> in enough danger that the police have not reclaimed my panic alarm or given me my old life back.  <br /><br /><br /><br />This morning however, I woke up feeling ab fab and raring to go!  <br /><br />I've binned the dreaded teasmade from hell; using my mobile phone alarm instead.  Works like a dream. Cool! <br /><br />So, is this why I am feeling so good?<br /><br />Nope!<br /><br />Have I won the pools?<br /><br />Nah!<br /><br />Did I have 'a friend' round to 'stay' last night? All night long? <br /><br />Maybe...<br /><br />Was it Mr Blue?<br /><br />YES! YES! YES! and...Well, let's just say that Mr Green is not the only one with a wide girth!<br /><br />(I think the post title gave it away a bit).

	 Mr Green the Re-cycling KING!
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      Something is definitely going down in that evil mind of Ms White Cow.  I can tell in the way she keeps grinning.  I know it's Red Nose Day, but she's freaking me out.  At least I knew where I was when she was in bitch mode. Smug mode is the pits.  <br /><br />I hasten to add, the ball was in her court, when I bounced into work this morning, after a healthy 20 minute session on my trampoline.  Full of the joys of spring because I saw Mr Blue, when I got home from work.  The present was my own mobile phone! No one can trace where I am and I'll be able to carry it where ever I go.  For that added protection. Mr Blue said that now I wouldn't have to wait for an emergency to get in touch with him.  He seems slightly jealous. Do you think he knows all about Mr Blonde?  Is nothing personal in my life?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm sidetracking.  In I bounced, feeling happy to be alive only to realise I was the only one at work, who had not bothered to dress up in some sort of whacky predominantly red outfit.  Yes, the ball was definitely in her court.  <br /><br />"Did you forget one of the biggest fund raising events in the year?"<br /><br />Wasn't it obvious?<br /><br />The Head Teacher stepped in to my rescue, for which I was grateful.  <br /><br />"I have some hair gel handmade by the nomads of the Peruvium Islands and a large tub of red glitter you can borrow."<br /><br />"Where is the glitter made?" I asked intrigued.<br /><br /> "Er...that came from Tesco's.  I tried other places but they had all completely sold out of anything in the line of red." He looked as bashful as the dwarf with the same name, only his cheeks were a mottled, sweaty pink.  (Uugh! Another pink thing I dislike!)<br /><br />Say no more?<br /><br />Of course I can. There's loads to tell you. I discovered something about the Head Teacher today.  He's a nice bloke and very green.  <br /><br />Not in looks, (as in the Incredible Hulk - Oh, God no!) but as in saving our world from destruction and decadence. ( He is the most ethical consumer I have ever met).  The original re-cycling KING!  Underneath that blatant 'listen to me I'm in charge round here' act, he is rather shy, caring and doesn't have a spiteful hair on his head.  (In fact, he hasn't got any hair).  Which is lucky as he would never be able to decide which shampoo to use!)<br /><br />I call him, Mr Green.  Helped me to compile this when I told him I was interested for any essay I was doing at college. He doesn't know the truth. <br /><br />Come dinner time, I found it heart-rendering when across the staff room he loudly asked, <br />"Sam, dear, what do you think about the concerns about Starbucks?"<br />" I didn't know there were any concerns." I said naively.  <br /><br />There was a mass exodus. <br />All but two. <br />Which included me.  <br /><br />For the rest of the dinner hour he explained about how Starbucks are supposedly using genetically engineered ingredients and something called Bovine Growth Hormone.  What ever that is!  <br /><br />But he it didn't stop there. There were  a number of other matters he thought i needed to know.   These, may be fact or fiction, but they have been embedded deep into my 'whirling cogs of a brain'. <br /><br />He walked me back to the office, sat me down in front of the computer and we trawled through the internet sites quite happily together.  Showing me interesting people boycotting companies in an effort to lobby for action to be taken against the unethical baddies. The fat cats and their slighter thinner relations.  <br /><br /><br />I  found out that he won't - <br /><br />-buy from Adidas as they use kangaroo skin to make some of their football boots!<br />-fly on certain airlines because some are known for transporting monkeys for research!<br />-trust anything  from a company called 'American Home Products' for it's cruel use of horses in the production of certain goods!<br /><br />Then he explained - <br /><br />-he never drinks coca-cola for its repression of trade union activity at its bottling plants in Columbia!<br />and someone called Donna Karan is apparently accountable for sweatshop conditions in it's supplier's factories. <br /><br />-he would never shop in GAP.  <br /><br />Come to think of it, I think he also said he never shops at KFC either, as chickens are reported to have a rough time there.  <br /><br />The site which explained about the comings and goings of GlaxoSmithKline, was one of the biggest customers to the Huntingdon Life Sciences animal testing laboratory.<br /><br />Therefore, he won't touch -<br /><br />Ribena, <br />Lucozade,<br />Aquafresh, <br />Beechams, <br />Macleans, <br />Solphadeine, <br />Nicorette, <br />Nightnurse, <br />Horlicks, <br />Contac <br />and Tums.<br /><br />Heaven knows, what this man does, as sweet as he is, when he's feeling poorly and is in need of some aspirin, cough syrup and a nice milky drink before bedtime. He wouldn't even be able to clean his teeth. But he does, and he's nothing like Mr Yellow teeth, by the way.  A soft, stuffed toy is the way I'd describe him.   As long it was made out of unbleached natural cotton in a great working environment where no animals where harmed. <br /><br />He could use a little extra fur on his head, though, and less whiskers on his chin. <br /> <br />If I had to chose which toy he'd be -  fluffy bunny or a moth-eaten ted? I'd bet my life on the latter.  I imagine he lives alone by the state of his jacket.  No woman would allow her man to go out of the house with those holes. <br /> <br />With the pay he's probably on, accompanied by the stress he's under (I've seen his paper work mountain with it's meandering trails) it would certainly not be the right time to give up smoking if going cold turkey was the only option.  <br />Lucky for him, he doesn't smoke.  There are two many evils in that too.<br /><br />He was, however, nearly in tears when he told me about how McDonalds ARE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS in animal welfare and ongoing talks are going well.  <br /><br />Don't you ever get the feeling that passionate people like Mr Green might, maybe, just maybe, be right in their reasons for supporting these boycotts .  Perhaps we should all take a leaf of his tree, stand in the hall way outside the Head Teacher's office and just THINK about what we are doing.  <br /><br />Having said this, I do not want to look like I am endorsing, any of these boycotts, or believing any of these rumours.  I just have a friend who does.  Mr Green.  I would like to apologise in advance for not knowing what I am talking about. AMEN. <br /><br />As Bart Simpson often says "It wasn't me!"<br /><br />OK?

      It's Friday!<br /><br />Thought I'd let you know quickly, Mr Blue has just rung me up.  He'll be popping round later, after work.  He's got a present for me.  I wonder what it is?????<br /><br />It may be just the thing I need to take my mind off Mr Blonde.  I could do with cheering up.  <br /><br />Must go now, as I've got to mop up the tea and wash my duvet, before I leave for work.  If this carries on, I'm going to bin my teasmade.  But it's the only alarm clock in the house.  <br /><br />I wonder what Mr Blonde is doing now?

      Mr Blonde can't make it until Tuesday night.  Two many white boards to install.<br /><br />I've bought a bottle of tequila and I'm going to watch tv in bed.  I should be annoyed as hell, scrub his number from my address book and wish him out of my life forever.  But having the carpet pulled out from under my feet so suddenly, so to speak, only makes me want more.<br /><br />I haven't got an address book anyway.  His number has been safely memorised.

      My Life in a Nutshell Part Two<br /><br />by Sam Black<br /><br />(only 20 points to go!) <br /><br />41. Pink is my favourite colour.<br />42. My 'necessity order' came through.  <br />43. I've had new nails and a new hairstyle - unrecognisable!<br />44. I dance round the house to Jimmy Hendrix (post 2.3.05).<br />45. I made a 'snow cow' on the beach.  <br />46. It kept me busy all day.  <br />47. CJ from Vice City keeps keeping me up late at night.<br />48. He will insist on visiting ‘Gay Gordo’s Bouffant Boutique!’ <br />49. My electric guitar is gathering dust.<br />50. So it my Dyson.<br /><br />51. When I was a child my au pair used to lock me in my room and go out clubbing.<br />52. She was only a few years older than me at the time.(Lied about her age). <br />53. Practicing star jumps on my trampoline is making me loose weight!<br />54. My new teasmade is wild and leaky (post 6.3.05)<br />55. Rainy dinner times are very noisy.<br />56. I'm a secret dinner blogger.<br />57. My first meeting with 'Little Johnny' didn't go quite as planned. I came away with something though.  A chunk of hair came away.  <br />58. David Banner is my idol. Or should that be the other man?  Mr Thingymajig.  Yes, I hate to disappoint you, but there are two of them! Both actors who really say, 'lovely' and 'Darling' and know how to do the air kissing dance when they meet<br />59. Are all Australian men such babes?<br />60. I think Ms White (aka 'The Cow') is older than she makes out. Her neck is beginning to get those creases which develop into granny wrinkles.  It will creep up on us all!

	 My Life in a Nutshell (Part 1)
	 
    </h3>

    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      This morning my alarm clock woke me up on time!  Although my pillow was soaked with tea I didn't let it get me down.  Between you and me, I set the alarm a half hour earlier than I needed to get up.  I don't know what's come over me.  I've changed.  It's as if I like getting up in the mornings, which I hated before!<br /><br /><blockquote>By seven o'clock I was dressed, downstairs and eating another bowl of crunchy nut cornflakes whilst watching the Chuckle Brothers.  I love Chucklevision!</blockquote>At work I spoke to the Head Teacher for the first time.  He's about 50 years old, small, round and balding.  I have more in common with him than any other person in the building.  Apart from 'Little Johnny', that is.  He also has issues to deal with.  I know where he's coming from.  I've been a mixed up child too.  <br /><br />So what have I decided to tell you tonight?<br /><br />How about a round up of my life as I see it so far?  (And, yes, I have been saving these all up! I've been bursting all week) <br /><br /><blockquote><strong>My Life in a Nutshell Part One<br /><br />by Sam Black<br /><br />(In 30 points!) </strong></blockquote><br />1. I'm a lost soul with a identity crisis.<br />2. Once I was someone else.<br />3. My new home is a council house by the sea.<br />4. Big Brother is watching me.<br />5. Politicians make my skin crawl.<br />6. Conspiracy theories are real.<br />7. My second home is interview room 444 (post  18.2.05).<br />8. I was once driven around in a bullet proof car.  Don't ask me what type, I'm not an expert.<br />9. I'm government property.<br />10.So are you.<br /><br />11. Mr Blue, my police handler (no, I'm not a dog! That really is his job title!) is absolutely gorgeous.<br />12. I think he likes me too.<br />13. Thanks to my bogus CV I now work in a school.<br />14. I drink too much Tequila.<br />15. We need more authority figures.<br />16. Safety should be a priority.<br />17. I bumped into 'Mr Yellow-teeth' again.  He was walking along the beach past my house a few hours ago. I WONDER WHERE HE IS NOW? <br />18. He reminds me of a politician.<br />19. I love my panic button.  <br />20. It's my security blanket.<br /><br />21. I'm a listaholic<br />22. I don't trust my home phone (post 23.2.05).<br />23. I watched a live exorcist (post 24.2.05).<br />24. Maxine Carr's case fascinates me.<br />25. My favourite item of clothing is my new pink suit (25.2.05)<br />26. I WANT A DOG!<br />27. Out of date shredded wheat won't kill you. (27.2.05)<br />28. I dream of axes<br />29. I work with a girl with a ghostly white face, who dresses in black and white. <br />30. That must make her the world's first walking, talking dead cow.<br /><br />Phew!  (more tomorrow, I'm afraid. (LOL!)<br /><br />By the way, the Office Cow kept staring strangely at me all day today.  She SMILED at me.  At first I was lulled into a false sense of security and felt guilty. Then I realised her smile was a smirk and felt angry, again!  She's hiding something, I know it.  Something is up her sleeve.  I can feel it in my water.<br /><br /> Now, I'm sitting in the back room in the sunshine room, as I have grown to call it.   Mesmorised by the violent crashing waves as it spits bubbling froth onto the sand. <br /><br />Living by the sea is not as romantic as it sounds.  The constant lapping waves, screeching sea gulls and the smell of salt, fish and bird poo, is <em>not</em> how I expected a beach life to be.  <br /><br />The spooky night sounds are the worst.  That's why I have the telly on so loud.  Since the begining of me new life I have come to the decision, I do not like to be left alone.  <br /><br />Especially at night.<br /><br />Oh well, ONLY TWO MORE NIGHTS AND I'M GOING OUT WITH MR BLONDE! (See OZZIE WONDERLAND post). <br /><br />Maybe I won't spend Saturday night on my own!
