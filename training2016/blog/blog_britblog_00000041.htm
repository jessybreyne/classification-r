      Weird how sometimes your life suddenly accelerates and you find yourself struggling to keep up.<br />Well, I think my credit card issues have been resolved. The bank has credited me in full for the amount those dirty dogs pinched. Had a fantastic Halloween party last weekend, got mind numbingly drunk and snogged a witch. Saw One Flew Over the Cuckoo nest in the West End a couple of nights ago, it's very good, I can't recommend it highly enough. I had my doubts about Christian Slater being able to pull off McMurphy but he managed it very well.<br />Work is very busy, but at the same time is actually starting to interest me which is something I haven't felt about work for the best part of a decade. Although having a few dramas with one of our publications that I am now suddenly in charge of - which is causing me to lose a bit of sleep.<br />I'm sitting a philosophy exam first thing tomorrow morning. Unfortunately I haven't had much time to study so it could be a little hairy tomorrow, hopefully I'll be able to blag my way through it.<br />Then I'm flying to the States for a weeks holiday and the opportunity to give the yanks a hard time about their choice of president. I'm spending most of my time there in New York, which to my understanding, voted overwhelmingly for Kerry. Why is it that all the redneck hillbilly states that like God, guns and mullets vote for Bush?<br />Nearly managed to take a tube that didn't have someone on it that was reading The Da Vinci Code - then I saw someone reading a Polish (I think) translation of it.<br />

	 Ripped off
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      An email from my mother turned up work on Thursday morning telling me that there were some strange transactions on my latest credit card statement. (I get my credit card statements sent to my parents address in New Zealand). She told me I seemed to be doing a lot of spending in Brighton. I said that was odd as I have never been to Brighton. So I log onto my bank's internet banking and download my credit card report.<br />Some swine managed to get hold of my credit card details and maxed it out over a one week period. I can't figure out how this happened, as I immediately checked for and found the credit card in my wallet - where it has been this entire year. I spoke to the banks fraud office that evening when they got into work (12 time gap between London and New Zealand) and they seemed to think that my card was copied by a retailer and a duplicate card made. Luckily they have already credited me for the bogus transactions.<br />

      ...you have to put up with the rain.<br /><br />Forecasters a preparing Ol' Blighty for one of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3738824.stm">coldest winters on record</a>. Bring it on I say. I do like very hot weather, especially if there is are beaches, bikinis and margaritas involved. However I also like very cold weather, especially when snow, hot fires and cosy pubs are near to hand. What I don't like is that boring type of weather that sits between the two extremes. When it is overcast and not hot, but also, not cold, it just makes me feel flat. There is no desire to go to the beach or lie in the park, but also sitting inside by the heater and watching the snow fall is not an option. I'm never sure what to do with myself of boring weather days.<br />

	 Chip 'n' Putt
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      Went out an played golf with some of the boys today. Real golf courses seem to be few and far between in central London so we had to content ourselves with the nine hole Chip 'n' Putt at Queens Park. A party of six with a diverse range of abilities made for some interesting round and a few scary moments for the local squirrels. I used to play quite a bit of golf back home as I lived just down the road from a golf course and was quite upset at how bad I have become after almost a year with no practice. I don't think the council operated facility offered the best equipment, the shaft of my putter was about as straight as a banana. Still, a poor workman blames his tools - I must get out for a bash a bit more often.<br />

	 A crazy on the tube
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      Got in the tube this evening to go home and a lady sitting a few seats along from me spoke to me. I failed to notice the purposefully averted eyes of my fellow passengers who were pretending to be deeply engrossed in books, magazines and the ceiling and I said 'Excuse me' to her as I didn't quite hear what she said. A fraction of a second later the smell of White Diamond Cider and a realisation that she was as mad as a cut snake hit me.<br />Unfortunately at this point, by talking to her, she had decided I was a kindred spirit and started rambling on to me about all sorts of nonsense about Al Qaeda the IRA etc... I'm too polite to start ignoring someone who is talking to me, no matter how crazy they are. So I nodded away and made reassuring non-threatening noises. Then she started pulling up her skirt to show me her scabby bleeding knees and tried explain to me how she had fallen down somewhere. At this point I decided to change the topic and asked her where she was going. 'Euston' she said, I told her that Euston was in North London and she was in a tube heading to South London. She jumped up and started screaming about how 'fucking evil' people were and tried to get out of the tube. However we were moving and between stations so she did not have much success getting the doors open, thankfully. When we reached the next station the doors opened she fell onto the platform, picked herself up and stumbled off into the distance.<br />A man sitting across from me in the carriage smiled at me sympathetically and rolled his eyes.<br />

      Spent a long weekend in Germany with a friend of mine who lives there. Stayed in a small village in the middle of nowhere called Hohenwestedt. It was nice to get out of London for a bit and see a bit of countryside, even if the North German countryside is largely covered in wind turbines.<br />On Friday I took a day trip to Kiel on the coast in North Germany and had a poke around some tourist spots. Got to have a look inside a U-Boot (U995) which is parked up on the beach as a tourist attraction just north of Kiel, which was quite interesting for me having be brought up on a substantial diet of war movies. It can't of been much fun to be on a submarine in WW2, it was a lot smaller than I had imagined it, housed 27 men - and had a toilet that wouldn't flush below 25 feet.<br />Was most pleased to find a children's Knight Rider coin operated car (yes, KITT, it even had a picture of David Hasselhof on the back) outside one of the German supermarkets, I tried to get in it and have a go but on the of the supermarket workers there started yelling at me in German, I don't know what she was saying but she didn't look happy.<br />German is a tricky language and there is a lot more too it that just pronouncing Ws as Vs and putting two dots above your Os and Us. Trying to communicate with my friend's parents who speak no English whatsoever was a pretty much a lost cause, trying to explain how you spent your day using only charades is not easy.<br />I'm not the best with foreign languages. I spent the day starving in Hamburg on Saturday worrying about going into a cafe and asking for a coffee and bagel in my very limited German and making a complete arse out of myself. When I actually did go in the conversation went something like this:<br /><blockquote><p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>"Um, eine, Cafe Latte and, und, eine, um, Bagel, with er mit, creme cheese, er, bitte"</em></p><p><strong>Coffee Guy:</strong><em> "Would you like the small, medium or large coffee"</em></p><p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>"Large... um, danke"</em></p></blockquote><p>I almost got stuck in Hamburg. The thing about Germany is there is almost nothing written in English, so was feeling quite pleased with myself for having worked out how to get a train ticket back to Hohenwestedt from the computer ticketing machine and figuring out which platform the train was leaving from. I even helped a local girl who was catching the same train as me find the platform as well. Anyway, I was sitting down waiting for this train when a announcement came on the loudspeaker - in German - which I couldn't understand. Luckily the girl who I'd helped earlier came running up to me and said that the platform had just been changed and we had to run to the other side of the station to the new platform. It would have been a long cold night at the Hamburg Hopbahnhoff if I'd missed that train.</p><br />

      I spent the day getting mocked by my work colleagues. Why you ask. My Star Wars trilogy DVD set from Amazon got delivered to my office and apparently I showed a little to much enthusiasm when it arrived. One girl even told me that I seem to get 'weirder' every day. I'm a little hurt. I am merely a man who enjoys the simple pleasures in life. One such simple pleasure being Star Wars.<br />Spent the evening round at some like-simple-minded friends and watched episode 4, tomorrow night its going to be episode 5! And I'll leave it to the imagination about what I'm doing on Wednesday night!<br />Gotta go, it's almost time for my other vice - The Sopranos!<br />

      Tried to go up the <a href="http://www.30stmaryaxe.co.uk/">Gherkin</a> yesterday which was open to the public as part of the London Open House weekend. For those that don't know what the Gherkin is, it's the big phallic looking building in the middle of The City. Unfortunately when I got to the building, at about midday, there was a 2 kilometre long queue to get in which was moving at the pace of a arthritic snail. Not being blessed with much patience I decided to flag it and went into Westminster and had a tour of the old Admiralty Offices at 26 Whitehall, now home to the Cabinet and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Apparently the admiralty board room looks exactly the same as it did when the building was built in 1726 (but with more security cameras).<br />I did plan to have another crack at getting up the Gherkin this morning but I slept in and I think my opportunity has passed.<br />

      Had random night out with work people last night and unleashed madness on the dance floor at the Islington Academy. Which you'll know if you've ever seen me dance is a very scary thing indeed. The DJ was playing all my favorite songs from my old school discos - Sweet Child' O Mine, Living on a Prayer, Smells Like Teen Spirit.<br />There is something very disturbing about seeing all the girls from my office gyrating furiously to early 90s rock. I don't think I'll be able to look at them the same way again on Monday. Still, it was a fun night, even though some bird managed to poke me in my ear with her lit cigarette which I was not too happy about - smokers are so inconsiderate.<br />Getting home was a nightmare and took about 2 hours. It's always and absolute horror getting home after a big night in London, especially from up in the north of London to where I live in south London. Somehow I got on a bus and ended up in Holborn - and I'm still not sure where that is - but that point I decided to bite the bullet and get a taxi. Extortionately priced but I guess if I hadn't got it I'd probably be still trying to find my way home.<br />I think Transport for London should consider running the tube 24 hours a day, but tube staff don't seem to have much of a work ethic. They're even planning a strike on New Years Eve to fuck up everybodies new year celebrations - fire the lot of them I say.<br /><br />

	 Batman at Buckingham

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      My daily lunchtime jogs have turned into semi-daily jogs. Must be more disciplined! I might watch Supersize Me again to give myself some motivation.<br />Disappointingly enough, I managed to jog past Buckingham Palace on Monday and completely miss <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3652502.stm">Batman</a> waving at crowds of embarrassed cops. I did notice on Wednesday they now now have a copper guarding the corner of Buckingham Palace where he climbed up. Poor girl looked very lonely and bored.<br />I really wanted to go down to the protest held at parliament Square yesterday, but unfortunately we were busy at work so I missed it. I've never been to a good protest before - especially one involving riot police indiscriminately bludgeoning the crowds with their truncheons. But I must admit the issue at hand wasn't one I felt terribly strongly about. It is, however, obviously an issue that is a concern to a great number of the British.<br />And, what issue is that? I hear you ask.<br />Genocide in Dafur? Nope.<br />War in Iraq? Narda.<br />Freedom for Tibet? Negative.<br />The big issue in the UK at the moment is that Parliment is voting to stop the upperclass chasing  a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3659030.stm">little furry animal </a>through the countryside.<br /><br />

      A girl at work wants to set me up on a date with a friend of hers.

	 Another year older...
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      Im now 27. Im undecided how I feel about this. I guess there is not much that one can do about aging so you just have to accept it. My mother has already been on the phone to remind me that when she was my age she was married with a child (me). I think she wants some grandchildren, unfortunately I find children repulsive and am never breeding.<br />Went out and had dinner with some friends in Brick Lane last night to celebrate my birthday. Brick Lane is a funky street in east London and is lined with Indian restaurants. As our group wandered down the street the restaurateur came out and tried to entice us into their establishment with offers of free beer and popadums. I was little drunk at this stage and can't remember the name of the place we finally dined at but they made one of the best Tikka Masalas that I have ever had, I could quite happily eat there every night of the week.<br />I didn't get many presents this year which is a bit disappointing, the older you get the less present you tend to get. One of my friends kindly gave me a can of White Diamond cider for my birthday. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of drinking White Diamond cider (please don't) it is quite possibly the worst drink imaginable. The bum that lives near my local tube stop always seems to be clutching a can of this loathsome liquid as he rants at me in the morning and by the look of him White Diamond does not do you any good. Still, what can you expect for £1?<br />

	 A quiet Friday night
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      I had a quiet night last night. Went and watched Dodgeball with a friend of mine at West India Quay which is right next to Canary Wharf the financial district in London so we had to dodge past lots of Suits and their lecherous PAs to get to the cinema. Was a very good movie - great cameos, even if the Lance Armstrong scene was a little twisted. If you're patient enough to wait until the end of the movie after the final credits you'll get to see Ben Stiller in the fatsuit have a rant about complexity in movies and do the milkshake dance. Very funny.<br />The trip home was a little awkward, we were going through the station when my friend saw a sign saying 'Station attendants Wanted, £10.10 per hour'. '£10.10 per hour!', she snorted 'Who'd work for that much'. I said I only made 13p more per hour than that, things became uncomfortable. I need a better job.<br />Managed to be in bed by ten that night which I thought was quite and achievement. However I was woken up at one in the morning by loud thumping on the door. Of course I thought the worse, there is a council estate across the road that lots of feral looking kids seem to belong to, I thought they were trying to make some sort of raid on my flat. However, next thing I know I hear my name called out. I risked a peek out the window and my flatmate was outside. He been out drinking and lost his keys. I let kindly let him in then tried to go back to sleep.<br />

	 God hates gays
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      Actually who the hell know what God likes or dislikes. Apparently, from what I remember from Sunday School he set fire to some shubbery once. Maybe he has something against box hedges. Anyway back home in good old New Zealand god has found a mouth piece to make his feelings known in Pastor Brian Tamaki. Undoubtedly a fence man.<br />Now don't get me wrong, I'm a pretty easy going liberal kind of guy, each to his own and so on and so forth. I really don't care what anyone else chooses say or how they live their lives as long as it doesn't have a negative impact on my life or others lives. Although I don't putt from the rough I don't have a problem with other people doing so, if the individual on the receiving end is likewise inclined. And like wise I don't have a problem with someone like Pator Brian having the freedom to speak his mind.<br />However, Pastor Brian has decided that god has told him that gays a bad and that there is <em>"an aggression in the homosexual spirit that wants to move in and pervert the whole of society".</em> Now normally I wouldn't have a problem with some deluded fool having a rant about something like this but unfortunately some of the sheep in New Zealand, and I'm talking about the ones with wool in their heads, have decided to follow Pastor Brian's call and have descended on parliament dressed in <a href="http://xtramsn.co.nz/news/0,,3762-3628608,00.html">black shirts with a red and white logo waving their hands in the air</a>. Heil Pastor Brian!<br />I feel there comes point where freedom of speech crosses a line to and starts to become a incitement of hatred and intolerance. I feel Pastor Brian and his sheep have happy-clapped over that line. The <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3012200a10,00.html">'Enough is Enough'</a> march on parliament was brought about to protest the Civil Unions Bill which legally recognises same sex marriages. Apparently same sex couplings are corrupting society, I'd like to think I'm part of society and I don't think I'm particularly corrupted. But, no, Pastor Brian says these same sex couplings are partly to blame for New Zealand's high abortion and teenage pregnancy rates. Now, I don't subscribe to this brand-church logic, so bear with me, but I would have thought the chances of pregnancy resulting from a same sex coupling would be... slim. Or did I read my form 3 biology text book wrong.<br />Pastor Brian has offered to teach Prime Minister Helen Clark about 'family values', an offer she turned down. Hardly surprising since Pastor Brian describe the prevalence of women in New Zealand's top jobs as 'the work of the devil'.<br />Writing about this nutcase and his church is making me angry, I'm going to bed.  And when Sunday morning comes round, I'll be having a lie in, then I'll plant a hedge.<br />

      I feel like such a celebrity whore. I was wandering through Leicester Square to catch the tube home at about half eight tonight when I saw a huge crowd of people and flashing lights by the Empire cinema so I sauntered up to see what was going on - next thing I know old Tom cruises past. It was the London premier of Collateral. I decided to hang round and gawk and saw Billy Connolly and a whole raft of Z-listers.<br />

	 Long weekend
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      I'm giving up drinking. Had a horrible Friday night. Actually I had a fantastic Friday night, it was the Saturday that was horrible. It was the sort of day where you feel completely ratshit but have to ring up all the people that you think you might have offended the night before to apologise. A very miserable day. I did go and see A Midsummer Nights Dream at the open air theatre at Regent's Park that night but I was feeling pretty awful and wanted to go to bed so probably didn't enjoy it as much as could have.<br />I'm a new man this week though. Inspired by the Olympics I've started a fitness regime. I now go jogging during my lunch break around St James and Green Parks - if I feel up to it tomorrow I might even venture into Hyde Park. The problem is that I am not at my peak fitnesswise at the moment, in fact my fitness level could be described as a trough. I am a Marianas Trench of althleticism. As I was coughing, spluttering and wheezing my round the park today I was asked by and elderly lady if I was all right but I was in the midst of deciding whether to throw up or pass out so I didn't reply. Still, what doesn't kill me can only make me stronger. All this fitness is going to add days to my lifespan.<br />

	 A couple of quiet drinks after work
	 
    </h3>

	<p>
      I should have known better. Went to meet up with a buddy of mine after work for a 'couple of quiets' - seven hours later I'm stumbling out of cab of an extortionist taxi driver looking for a kebab shop. Luckily I wasn't far from my old favourite, that's right, the good ol' Clapham Kebab House.<br />Still it was an interesting night, met up with some Canadians via some mutual friends and rocked around various bars in central London. It got a bit blurry during the night and I'm not 100% sure where we were most of the time but I do remember going the Gordon's Wine Bar near Embankment station. The wine bar is set up in a sort of underground cellar, remined me of a dungeon, it was hot as hell but still quite a unique location.<br />Am feeling not the best today so will have a quiet day watching the Olympics. Speaking of which - well done to the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3010766a10,00.html">Swindells</a>!<br />

	 The Joy of Bus
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      I've had a week long experiment with the London bus system and frankly it doesn't work for me. Although it's £10 per week cheaper than the tube I tend to end up in places I can't be bothered looking for a bus from and getting a day ticket for the tube at the extortionist day ticket prices and pay as much as I would for the tube anyway therefore it is nonsensical to take the bus from a financial standpoint. On the plus side taking the bus gives you a good view of London and you don't get that totally disorientated feeling you get taking the tube and popping up out of holes all over the city like some sort of demented merkat. Unfortunately the bus tends to take twice as long and you inevitably end up sitting next to someone that is smelly, has their personal stereo to loud, sniffs, coughs, blows nose to frequently or is just plain old. Admittedly this is a frequent problem on the tube as well but you only have to put up with it for half as long - and with the tube, it's like having a sauna with a lot of fully clothed people you don't like.<br />

	 Too many Kebabs
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      I've been over indulging during the past week. Too many late nights and too many late night meals at the Clapham Kebab House. I'm not usually an active social life kind of guy but things/people have conspired against me lately to lead me astray. But as I'm living well beyond my very limited means I've decided I'm going to have a quiet, boring week this week - to start off my boring week I'm staying up late tonight, but only to watch the new series of Sopranos that starts today.<br />I got a radical haircut last week at <a href="http://www.hairbyfairy.com">Hair by Fairy</a>. The hairdressers looked a little bit bohemian for me but it was cheap which worked in its favour - I chose the hairdresser/sylist/person-with-scissors with the least amount of facial piercings and hoped for the best. I'm now almost bald. Still I suppose its a good haircut to have in summer (my head is now less insulated) and I can hear more clearly without my shaggy mop over my ears. Apparently you are supposed to tip hairdressers in the UK but I'm still a bit wary about tipping anyone - when people start tipping me then I'll start tipping.<br />

	 Hot in the city
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      It was stinking hot in the city on Friday and over the weekend and London smells a bit rancid in the heat. Still it's better than the bleak winter I know is going to start to kick in a few months time.<br />Went out for dinner with some of the lads on Friday night and discussed ways to avoid forming shirt sweat stains when traveling on the tube. Apparently wearing a singlet under your shirt will help, it diffuses the moisture, although wearing one will probably make you warmer and you will probably sweat more. It was a delightful dinner conversation.<br />Watched New Zealand get beaten by Australia in the rugby on Saturday morning. I was in a bar full of Aussies and it was a bit depressing. I decided to cheer myself up by buying a new computer. Then I had to lug the thing back to my place via the tube system pissing off as many fellow tube travelers as possible by blocking doors/exit gates/escalators with my boxes. I even managed to knock some poor chap's bag out of the tube door and down the 'mind the gap'-gap to the rails below, he looked angry. Luckily the tube doors shut and tube took off with him in it and me on the platform before he could hit me or throw me onto the third rail. I made tracks before he came back. (I did tell the tube attendant where his bag was).<br />I spent the rest of the weekend drinking blackcurrant juice with lots of ice and trying not to go hyperthermic.<br />

      I managed to maim a girl playing softball in Hyde park last night - not intentionally. She was pitching and I was batting. Naturally I wanted to show off my athletic prowess and belted the ball as hard as I could, unfortunately I hit it straight at her and she got sconed squarely on the forearm. I felt terrible especially after the game when she showed me her arm and had the stitches from the ball imprinted on her skin. I told her a least she would have something to remember me by - she didn't seem thrilled about that.<br />In other news I've got reasonably settled into Clapham, although I'm starting to get to know the friendly staff at the Clapham Kebab House a little to well (I've had some mighty fine late night meals there over the past few days). I'm trying to reign in my night outs it's getting a bit out of control, and expensive - planning a quiet evening tonight sitting in the garden reading my book.<br />

      I doing my weekly shop in Clapham Sainsburys last night when I ran in a friend of a friend from back home. Very random - this is the third time in the past few months that I've stumbled across someone from back home who is now living in London. Makes you wonder if there is anyone left in New Zealand, I had a vision of <a href="'http://www.christchurch.org.nz/" 20target="">Christchurch</a> completely deserted apart from the occasional tumbleweed rolling down the streets.

	 Moving house

	         <div class="post-body">
	<p>
      I moved in to my new flat in Clapham North yesterday. Not the greatest of places but the flatmates seem nice enough and is only a couple of minutes walk to Clapham North tube. Felt terrible all through the move yesterday as I had a goodbye night out in Balham with my old flatmates - I got blind drunk and ended up dancing to funk at the <a href="http://www.thebedford.co.uk/" target="">Bedford</a> which is quite possibly the scariest pub in the world. Any illusions I was under that Londeners are sophisticated people were irrevocably shattered that night - I saw one too many sweaty people trying to dance to Abba's 'Dancing Queen'. I finished the night at the house of couple of Australian girls in Tooting drinking Pineapple liqueur on their balcony and listening to Franz Ferdinand. Odd night.<br />

      Had a sleepless night last night worrying about having nowhere to live and ending up like the raggedly dressed foul smelling man that accosts me for money each day from his sleeping bag in the uric smelling walkway leading to Charing Cross tube station. However this morning one of the girls from a flat I looked at in Clapham North in the weekend rang me and after making some thinly veiled threats about what would happen to me if I didn’t do my dishes said I could move in during the weekend. Most pleased now all I have to do is get a decent job and I'm set!<br />

      Seemed to be an inordinate number of women trying to manoeuvre prams onto the tube this morning. I doubt this is easy at the best of times but at morning rush hour I felt it would be nigh on impossible. However I was proved wrong as a rather well built lady crushed me against the door with her rancid smelling spawn on wheels. Where to these kids have to be so early in the morning anyway? Has a baby's life become so hectic that they shit themselves, wake up, throw up then have to catch the tube for a board meeting in the city?<br />

      Flat in Clapham fell through... my mate and his girlfriend have decided they are best off living on opposite sides of the city and just seeing each other in the weekends. So I'm back plodding the streets visiting flats and trying to make a decent first impression to potential new flatmates&nbsp;- which I'm finding exceptionally difficult as I have a blinding hangover (too much after work frivolity)&nbsp;and just would much rather prefer to spend the day in the garden drinking lime juice.<br />

      ...nothing really. Still not much&nbsp;progress on the flathunting front, which is a bit of a worry as I have to be out of my current house&nbsp;at the end of next week. Hopefully we'll put an offer in on the place we looked at in Clapham North the other day, but my friend's girlfriend might be digging her heels in a bit. She works in Uxbridge and he works east of Greenwich which are opposite sides of London - even if they can get something central they are both facing quite a long commute.&nbsp;I'm feeling a little selfish about getting them to pick a place on the Northern Line as it makes it really easy for me to get to and from work at Charing Cross. Still, you've got to look after number one, no one else is going to. <br /><br /><br />
