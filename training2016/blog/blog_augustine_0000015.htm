Last 
post 
of 
2003 
- I'll 
be 
offline 
from 
Monday 
until 
January 
3 or 
4.<BR>
Paul 
Mc 
Cartney 
on 
TV 
last 
night 
in 
Moscow, 
in 
Red 
Square, 
singing 
to 
an 
enraptured 
crowd. 
There 
was 
something 
uniquely 
moving 
about 
it 
and 
I thought: 
why 
isn't 
it 
all 
as 
simple 
as 
this? 
Why 
can't 
America 
be 
singing 
to 
the 
Iraquis, 
and 
vice-versa? 
Why 
can't 
Israelis 
and 
Palestinians 
be 
playing 
music 
to 
each 
other 
? (Daniel 
Barenboim 
did 
just 
that 
some 
time 
ago, 
formed 
and 
conducted 
an 
orchestra 
of 
young 
Palestinians 
and 
Israelis). 
And 
why 
aren't 
music 
and 
laughter 
taken 
more 
seriously 
than 
weapons 
and 
war 
as 
a means 
of 
settling 
disputes?<BR>

To

this

pain 
and 
terror 
and 
begin 
the

I'm

<P align="left"><FONT face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Don't 
know 
if 
anybody 
noticed 
but 
the 
'Time' 
post 
vanished 
for 
a couple 
of 
days 
and 
so 
did 
a few 
other 
things 
including 
my 
serenity. 
The 
host 
server 
was 
down 
which 
caused 
no 
end 
of 
rage 
and 
ranting 
on 
my 
part 
whilst 
They, 
the 
offending 
party, 
remained 
impassive 
and 
righteous. 
Sometimes 
I wish 
I were 
back 
in 
the 
good 
old 
days 
when 
I shunned 
all 
things 
computerized 
and 
was 
blissfully 
ignorant 
of 
blogs, 
broadbands, 
servers, 
scanners, 
software, 
stats, 
etc. 
etc. 
Anyway, 
I'm 
back 
but 
only 
by 
sheer 
superhuman 
bad 
temper. 
<BR>
<BR>
Speaking 
of 
stats: 
do 
you 
think 
they 
tell 
you 
how 
many 
people 
visited 
your 
beloved 
blog 
today, 
yesterday, 
last 
week, 
last 
month? 
And 
do 
you 
bask 
in 
glory 
when 
the 
numbers 
are 
up 
or 
sink 
into 
despondency 
when 
they're 
down? 
Ha! 
Well, 
so 
did 
I until 
I chanced 
upon 
<A href="http://www.goldmark.org/netrants/webstats/" target="_blank">this 
site:</A> 
<FONT color="#FFCC99"><I>Why 
Web 
Usage

than) 
Useless</I></FONT>. 
Read 
it 
and 
wake 
up 
to 
reality. 
One 
more 
illusion 
bites 
the 
dust. 
But, 
hey, 
reality 
schmerality, 
nothing's 
going 
to 
stop 
me 
checking 
those 
stats 
every 
few 
hours. 
And 
by 
the 
way, 
see 
that 
new 
little 
logo 
at 
the 
top 
of 
my 
sidebar? 
I <I>think 
</I>it<I> 
</I>means 
you 
can 
now, 
how 
you 
say, 
get 
a feed 
from 
me? 
So 
you 
can, 
if 
you 
wish, 
be 
warned 
whenever 
I update. 
Try 
it 
and 
let 
me 
know

it 
works?

Thursday 
evening 
we 
were 
in 
the 
audience 
at 
the 
ICA 
(Institute 
of 
Contemporary 
Arts) 
to 
hear 
the 
brilliant 
cartoonist 
<A href="http://www.lambiek.net/spiegelman.htm" target="_blank">Art 
Spiegelman</A> 
in 
conversation 
with 
<A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/books/author/pullman/" target="_blank">Philip 
Pullman</A>, 
author 
of 
the 
latest 
Big 
Thing 
(after 
Harry 
Potter), 
the 
trilogy 
&quot;<I><A href="http://www.powells.com/authors/pullman.html" target="_blank">His 
Dark 
Materials</A></I>&quot;. 
(On 
the 
left, 
a quick 
on-the-spot 
sketch 
by 
Natalie). 
You 
can 
tell 
where 
my 
sympathies 
lie, 
can't 
you? 
Yep, 
Art's 
my 
man. 
They 
couldn't 
be 
more 
different. 
Spiegelman 
the 
archetypal 
New 
Yorker, 
funny 
and 
worried, 
self-deprecating 
and 
cocky, 
no 
bullshit, 
no 
pretense, 
still 
boyish 
and 
enthused 
about 
what 
he 
does 
and 
confident 
that 
he 
does 
it 
well. 
But 
essentially 
a loner, 
one 
who 
has 
been 
down 
into 
the 
depths 
of 
despair. 
Whereas 
Pullman, 
the 
Anglo-Saxon 
academic, 
oozed 
the 
kind 
of 
authority 
that 
comes 
of 
belonging 
to 
a certain 
class, 
a certain 
milieu, 
used 
to 
having 
the 
approval 
of 
his 
peers 
and 
now 
also 
flushed 
with 
commercial 
success. 
His 
lavish 
praise 
of 
Spiegelman's 
work 
seemed 
to 
me 
as 
if 
he 
was 
reading 
from 
one 
of 
his 
own 
reviews 
and 
his 
questions 
were 
like 
exam 
questions, 
expecting 
certain 
kinds 
of 
answers. 
But 
Art's 
answers 
were 
always 
fresh 
and 
direct 
and 
from 
another 
angle, 
another 
world 
altogether. 
He 
talked 
about 
his 
current 
work-in 
progress: 
an 
opera-that's-not-an-opera, 
with 
cartoon 
characters, 
speech 
bubbles 
etc. 
And 
about 
his 
visceral 
response 
to 
9/11, 
&quot;<I><A href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n05/spie02_html" target="_blank">In 
the 
Shadow 
of 
No 
Towers</A></I>&quot; 
(which 
the 
US 
media 
wouldn't 
publish). 
And 
about 
the 
making 
of 
his 
most 
famous 
book 
&quot;<I><A href="http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/maus.htm" target="_blank">Maus</A></I>&quot;, 
a tour 
de 
force 
in 
every 
sense, 
which 
raised 
the 
comics 
medium 
to 
a level 
it 
doesn't 
often 
reach 
- depth 
of 
characters 
and 
narrative 
power 
as 
in 
<A href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Ekafka/intro.html" target="_blank">Kafka</A>, 
graphic 
expressiveness 
as 
in 
<A href="http://www.artgalleryone.com/Goya/Los%20Desastres.htm" target="_blank">Goya</A> 
- yet 
something 
altogether 
different 
from 
either 
of 
them. 
Was 
I inspired 
by 
the 
evening? 
You 
bet. 
Came 
home 
and 
had 
to 
be 
restrained 
from 
staying 
up 
all 
night 
(again) 
to 
work 
on 
the 
gnovel. 
But 
have 
added 
some 
new 
panels, 
so 
<A href="blaugarchive.html">go

one 
of 
those 
people, 
those 
naive, 
myopic 
people, 
who 
hears 
'Thou 
shalt 
not

louder 
than 
I hear 
'an 
eye 
for 
an 
eye'. 
In 
some 
ways 
it's 
a compassionate 
humanistic 
ideal 
of 
mine 
but 
it's 
also 
self-preserving 
pragmatism: 
if 
we 
endorse 
'an 
eye

an 
eye' 
then 
our 
history 
will 
blind 
us. 
I'm 
one 
of 
those 
people 
who 
believes 
imperialism 
is 
morally 
wrong 
- the 
old 
style 
imperialism 
of 
the 
Raj 
and 
the 
Congo 
and 
Opium 
wars 
and 
the 
new 
style 
economic 
and 
cultural 
imperialisms. 
I'm 
one 
of 
those 
people 
who 
believes 
that 
if 
we 
were 
sussed 
and 
wise 
enough 
to 
be 
able 
to 
tell 
other 
countries 
how 
to 
run 
their 
affairs 
then 
we 
would 
realise 
that 
we 
shouldn't 
do 
so 
by 
threat 
and 
force 
and 
sanction, 
that 
we 
probably 
shouldn't 
do 
so 
at 
all. 
I'm
