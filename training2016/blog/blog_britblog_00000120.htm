      <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050315/D88RH9R00.html">Court Shootings Suspect Appears at Hearing</a> Big question of the day for moonbats and their politically correct language...Why are news organizations and the like still referring to Brian Nichols as the "suspect?"  Don't we have enough eye-witness testimony and video to write something like this?:<blockquote><center>"Man who shot judge has been caught"</center><justify><br />Today the man who knocked a 51 yr old woman guard over the head (which by the way was caught on video) and then shot his way out the courtroom while attending a hearing on his rape case (of which he is a suspect) appears before a magistrate to be informed that he will be charged with murder for the death of the judge and three other people.<br /><br />"We saw a man do it, and this is definitely the man who we saw", said several bystanders who happened to be in court that fateful day.</justify></blockquote>That would remove the "suspect" title and place the story into the proper light that it deserves, because there isn't anyone within swinging-a-dead-cat-distance who would refer to this monster as a "suspect" outside of the moonbat news organizations that are using this lingo because of the fear that this guy's constitutional rights might somehow be violated by referring to him as the "murderer!"<br /><br />Give us a break!<br /><br />Uncle Jack

      You might remember the story I told of the wife and me having a confrontation with an Irish Moonbat on our flight home from Ireland.  Well today, in spite of the money we spent at the Waterford Crystal Factory, sales at the famous glass maker are down this year, so layoffs are imminent. <a href="http://finance.myway.com/jsp/nw/nwdt_rt.jsp?section=news&feed=ap&src=601&news_id=ap-d88qnad00&date=20050314">Waterford Issues Profits Warning<br /></a><blockquote><font color="red">Waterford Wedgwood has been hit hard in recent years by the weakening U.S. dollar. North America accounts for much of its business, including about half of sales of its marquee product, Waterford crystal.</font></blockquote>Looks like all things American aren't so evil after all, eh, Kevin?!  I wonder if you'll be one of the people laid off, and if so who will you blame, America?<br /><br />The bad news here for us Americans is that Kevin and his clan, so to speak, spend their money here in the states.  Europeans have been scooping up American real estate at record paces and record prices. But if fewer Americans are buying Irish goods due to the decline in our dollar, well, that's fewer euros to come back this way to support current and elevated real estate prices.<br /><br />Ah, the ebb and flood of a market economy. I love America.<br /><br />Uncle Jack

	 Bankruptcy Blues
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      I've been watching intently the passing of the change in bankruptcy laws and wanted to report on it after the vote was in.  It's in.  It passed the Senate 74-25 (don't know who missed their vote. check the beach for a windsurfing senator. ha, just kidding) Anyway, as a Financial Planner I've been watching this issue because it is near and dear to my heart, not just because of my profession, but because I know people who sought protection (several years ago) under Chapter 7 (wiping out all debts) and their irresponsibility was part of the inspiration for me getting into the business of planning.<br /><br />I've read several articles on the topic and what I've noticed is that by and large the majority of negative comments from bankruptcy attorneys is due to their potential drop in business that will result from the stricter filing requirements. You see, when I read an article from a news site and someone makes a comment, good or bad, I look for the potential motivating force behind their comment. Today, for the pizza-resistance of all articles, this one titled "US Senate clears last obstacle for bill to punish bankrupt debtors" takes the prize for the most moonbat riddled comments of all.  I'll provide the link at the end of my post, but first I have a few comments to make of my own, and a few highlights of the bill.<br /><br />There will be a new threshold established for erasing or paying down debts, and it will be based on median income.  If you're below it and you need protection under Chapter 7, you'll get it, but may still be required to jump through some credit counseling hoops.  If you're above the median income level and file for bankruptcy, you'll be forced into credit counseling and may have to alter your filing to Chapter 13, which requires you to pay back your debts over time.  That's the basics.<br /><br />Now for my take: There are consequences to every choice you make as a consumer, business owner, employee, etc.  It's one of those irrefutable laws of nature, that for every action there is a reaction.  The loudest arguments against the change to the bankruptcy laws are the ones where you end up in financial trouble due to medical costs, or sudden financial emergency such as layoffs or divorce.  But how many of these bankruptcies are as a result of irresponsibility, poor planning, or making purchases out of want versus need?<br /><br />I'm happy for the change in the law, though I am curious to see the outcome of the changes.  My personal viewpoint, driven by my profession where I coach and encourage all my clients to have an emergency fund, is to plan ahead for such "sudden financial emergencies." In this day when we need to have everything right now, it's very hard to forego the "want" in favor of the "need."  Do you need that new flat-screen hdtv, or do you want it?  Are you in a dead-end job that could be eliminated at the next turn of the economic cycle, and if so are you gaining knowledge and training now to easily find a new job if it comes to a layoff?  Health problems and catastrophies happen, but are we taking less care of ourselves generally at the potential consequence of something happening down the road and then we label it an emergency, either due to being underinsured or gambling that "it won't happen to me."?  Before you respond with horror stories of medical emergencies that ruined families, consider what they could've done to avert that financial catastrophe.<br /><br />There's another bubble blowing up slowly in front of us, and the change in the bankruptcy laws could be the first pin-prick that pops that bubble. It's the current real-estate boom and the price appreciation of your home.  Interest rates are on the rise. Most credit card borrowers' cards are tied to the prime rate and some recent home buyers' loans are variable. As rates rise, spending will slow as people struggle to meet minimum payments, and with the change in the bankruptcy laws making that a less desirable option, the personal responsibility card (which should be the first card pulled) will finally have to be played.  I'm no Nostradamus, but I'm not walking around blind either.  As with the tech bubble that blew up five years ago yesterday, we'll only know what caused the pop after it happened.  I'm trying to see what will cause this pop before it happens, and overleverage is a likely candidate for the prize.<br /><br />Now for the link to the most moonbat riddled cry-baby post of the day.  I found it at <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/mar2005/bank-m10.shtml">wsws.org</a>.  Before you guess what the title is, here's a quote from the article.<blockquote><font color="red">The Bankruptcy and Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 is one of the most blatant pieces of class legislation ever introduced in Congress. Its sole purpose is to extract an additional pound of flesh from middle-income families ruined by health calamities or job loss, to swell the profits of the financial services industry and the ruling class as a whole.</font></blockquote>Before you beat the enemy, you have to know how he thinks, and these moonbats don't ever think that personal responsibility should count.<br /><br />Have a stellar day!<br /><br />Uncle Jack

      You can't dream up comedy better than an illegal alien, from America, hiking to Canada to see his internet girlfriend because he's in love but can't go to Canada legally because of a former conviction and she can't come to L.A. because she can't afford the trip, and then he gets caught frozen half-to-death on a golf course in Winnepeg and has to leave Canada without ever seeing the girlfriend. Read all about it at, <a href="http://reuters.myway.com/article/20050309/2005-03-09T143727Z_01_N08653378_RTRIDST_0_ODD-ODD-CANADA-FROSTBITE-DC.html">"Oh yeah, this is good humor"</a>:<blockquote><font color="red">A Los Angeles man who sneaked into Canada in February to see his Internet girlfriend will be deported -- minus all his fingers and some of his toes, the Winnipeg Sun newspaper reported Tuesday.</blockquote></font>"And I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more; <br />just to be the man who'd walk 5000 miles to fall down at your door" <br />- The Proclaimers, I'm Gonne Be (500 miles)<br /><br />Uncle Jack

      I'm listening to The Rush Limbaugh Show and today's guest host is Walter E. Williams, an economist, like me, and a man of considerably darker skin than me.  He was shamelessly plugging his books and his website during the show.  No problem, I still like what he has to say.<br /><br />I went to his website and I clicked on a link titled "gift" and here is what I found:<blockquote><font color="red">Proclamation of Amnesty and Pardon Granted to <br />All Persons of European Descent<br /><br />Whereas, Europeans kept my forebears in bondage some three centuries toiling without pay,<br /><br />Whereas, Europeans ignored the human rights pledges of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution,<br /><br />Whereas, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments meant little more than empty words, <br /><br />Therefore, Americans of European ancestry are guilty of great crimes against my ancestors and their progeny.<br /><br />But, in the recognition Europeans themselves have been victims of various and sundry human rights violations to wit: the Norman Conquest, the Irish Potato Famine, Decline of the Hapsburg Dynasty, Napoleonic and Czarist adventurism, and gratuitous insults and speculations about the intelligence of Europeans of Polish descent,<br /><br />I, Walter E. Williams, do declare full and general amnesty and pardon to all persons of European ancestry, for both their own grievances, and those of their forebears, against my people.<br /><br />Therefore, from this day forward Americans of European ancestry can stand straight and proud knowing they are without guilt and thus obliged not to act like damn fools in their relationships with Americans of African ancestry.<br /><br />Walter E. Williams, Gracious and Generous Grantor</font></blockquote>Thanks, Walter.  Not only is that some good humor, but I also appreciate your economic points of view. <br /><br />In support of my economist brethren, I hereby provide the link to the gift, <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/gift.html">Amnesty and Pardon</a> and to his main site <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/">Walter E.

	 Ten Things
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      I saw this topic on another blog and thought I'd play along, so here goes, the Ten Things I've Done You Probably Haven't:<br /><br />1. Stopped dating a girl because of the shoes she wore.<br /><br />2. Hung out of a helicopter door at 12,500 feet altitude.<br /><br />3. Survived 5 car crashes as passenger or driver without a scratch on my body.<br /><br />4. Drove across country, San Francisco, CA to Dayton, OH in 44 hours without sleeping.<br /><br />5. Sailed a boat backwards under the Golden Gate bridge, unintentionally!<br /><br />6. Ran a mile in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />7. Appeared in a television commercial, still airing.<br /><br />8. Memorized every line of a movie.<br /><br />9. Swam in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean in the same day.<br /><br />10. Ordered the driver of a horse-drawn carriage to stop because the horse was obviously tired.<br /><br />If you can claim to have done 5 or more of the same things, e-mail me and let's compare stories for some laughs.  If you want to make sarcastic remarks about my ten things, have a blast.  I'll respond in-kind or share the story where appropriate. And, feel free to post your own "ten things."  Have a stellar day!<br /><br />Uncle Jack

      Hey kids, no I have not fallen off the face of the planet.  I had a busy week and was mostly surfing and lurking on other blogs of friends of mine.  Plus, I wanted people to chew on the tax/portfolio question for some good digestion before moving on to other things.<br /><br />Have a stellar day, and God bless the United States of America.<br /><br />Oh wait, I do have something to report today.  My wife's high school (Melinda is a teacher) had the band perform some classic Americana music last night for a good-sized crowd, and I was the videographer.  In the program they had a piece about the National Anthem and how Francis Scott Key was inspired to write the words to that song, September 20, 1814.  The Star Spangled Banner became our National Anthem in 1931.  The program stated what a shame it was that less than 40% of the American citizenry knew the words to the song, yet they did not print the words in the program.  I thought that was a darn shame because it would've been a great opportunity to educate the attending audience.  So, here are the words:<blockquote><font color="red">Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light,<br />What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?<br />Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,<br />O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?<br />And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br />Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.<br />O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br /><br />On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,<br />Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br />What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,<br />As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?<br />Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,<br />In full glory reflected now shines on the stream:<br />'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave<br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br /><br />And where is that band who so vauntingly swore<br />That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion<br />A home and a country should leave us no more?<br />Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution.<br />No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br />From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:<br />And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br /><br />Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand<br />Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!<br />Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land<br />Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.<br />Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,<br />And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."<br />And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave<br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</font></blockquote><br /><br />Like I said, God bless the United States of America<br /><br />Uncle Jack

	 $1.33 Versus $1.00
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      In the poll this month I asked you to pick which dollar you thought was more valuable, the tax dollar or the portfolio dollar.  In spite of whatever feelings you may have to the contrary, the correct answer is the Tax Dollar.  Here's why:<br /><br />The tax dollar's worth is easy to prove as it is simply the dollar divided by 1 minus your marginal tax rate. [e.g. - 1/(1 - 0.25) = $1.33]  Your marginal tax rate is the rate that is taxed on each new dollar earned as ordinary income.  If you want to argue that the portfolio dollar would be taxed at long-term gains' rate or that your ordinary income is only taxed in the 15% bracket, that would be 1/(1 - 0.15) = $1.18.  Both of those equations result in a known quantity or value. (i.e. - 33% or 18%)  You have to get an 18% or 33% return on your investment in order to be left with a dollar, and at what return on your investment does one dollar represent?<br /><br />Want to argue that your money grows tax-free in a ROTH IRA and the portfolio dollar is worth whatever return the portolio earns?  Okay, but the question has to be asked in return, why are you invested in a ROTH?  Answer, to save your portfolio earnings from taxation. Also, without knowing what investment you choose to put that money, it's anyone's guess what your return will be if you're invested in anything aside from a fixed-rate investment. And you can bet a tax dollar that there isn't anything that will return 18%-30% risk-free.<br /><br />Maximize your tax efficiency. It's the best return on your time and money.<br /><br />Uncle Jack

	 The Pope
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      There is a poll on the <a href="http://catholic.org/">Catholic.org</a> website that asks the question, "Should Pope John Paul II resign?  The current tally is 78% no, 16% yes, and 5% unsure.  I love those who are unsure.  Come on, have an opinion.<br /><br />Anyway, since we have a Pope whose age is increasingly old for a man in his position, and he suffers from Parkinson's Disease, and he recently had a tracheotomy, and he has been the Pope longer than every other Pope before him save two, the question is becoming more and more prevalent as he draws closer to death.  Should he resign?<br /><br />I say no.  He took that position for life, and as failing as his health may be, by staying in his position as the Supreme Pontiff he sets an example for all of us Catholics who have vowed to love and honor our spouses until death parts us. He is in effect married to his position as the leader of all Catholics.<br /><br />How do you resign to God?  "Thanks God for a wonderful career, can I have my gold watch and pension now?"  Nope, you're not done. Get back in there and tough it out to the end, you're the example for all who follow you in worshipping God and his teachings.<br /><br />If you would like more information on how they select a Pope, please click <a href="http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp" title="How the Pope is elected">here</a> for a quick read that is sure to enlighten both Cradle Catholics and Catholic Converts as well as interested observers from other religions.  There are 6 billion people on the planet, and about 1 billion call themselves Catholic.<br /><br />Hang in there, Pope John Paul, and may God continue to bless you in your work and in your health.<br /><br />Uncle Jack

	 Schiavo Update
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <a href="http://www.blogsforterri.com/archives/2005/02/stay_extended_i.php">Blogs for Terri</a> has an update regarding the extension of the Stay of Execution.  Please click on the link to see the story.  Here's an interesting quote from the story<blockquote><font color="red">What we know for sure is that Charges of neglect, abuse, adultery and conflict of interest on the part of Michael Schiavo in his capacity as the guardian, have existed for a very long time and came to a head back in <a href="http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=35452">Nov 2003</a>.</font></blockquote>I read an excellent post at <a href="http://www.blindmindseye.com/archives/2005/02/following_the_m_1.php">Blind Mind's Eye</a> blog regarding the obvious but rarely mentioned investigative technique of "following the money."  Definitely worth a read.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Florida Department of Children & Families (formerly HRS) is reportedly getting involved to look into whether or not this is an abuse case and to continue to question Michael Schiavo's suitablility as a Guardian.  It is at this point that I need to remind my readers that Terri Schiavo is disabled, not terminal.  Removing the feeding tube is not much different than refusing to feed a disabled child you care for in your home.  If you do not have a disabled child, perhaps you know someone who does.  Ask them this simple question, "If you could walk away, would you?"  Forget the "why" that could immediately follow the answer to that question and focus on the yes or no, or maybe as the case may be.<br /><br />Without referring to a master plan from God, or claiming that fate sometimes deals us a bad hand, what is the measure of your character when faced with such circumstances?  What course of action would you take if you were in Michael's shoes? Is there a way to even guess without having to personally deal with the hardships that come with caring for a disabled person? I do not know my personal answers to these questions as I write this, but I am at least asking them.  It is in the light of a case like this where we see the measure of our own character, if we can think for a moment what our choices would be, and it is in that dark "what if" that you need to dwell before you can decide where you stand on this issue.  It is very easy to be detached from the issue and pass a perceived impartial judgment on what should be done. (i.e. - let the man move on, relieve her of that existence, save the life, spare the cost and agony, etc.)  But being detached is exactly the wrong thing to do.  This issue does affect you because your own particular "what if" is potentially looming on the horizon.  You have to know how you would carry yourself through. Life, God, a higher power, fate of the big blue marble, however you refer to it, IT has given you an example from which to learn so that you can apply it to your own life if the need arises.  Do you learn from this example, or do you remain detached and look on as an "interested observer," never applying the lessons you could've learned from Terri Schiavo?<br /><br />A disabled woman fights for her own life in spite of the scientific evidence to the contrary. Did that huge list of bloggers taking part in bringing this issue to your lap just magically appear?  No. They, we, I got involved and personalized this issue.  Terri Schiavo failed to plan for her own "what if", and the man who said he would care for her in sickness and in health has decided that the sickness is too much for him and/or her to bear. Having failed to plan for that "what if," he still has a responsibility to the office he signed on to serve, that of husband.  If he wants to walk away, okay, then let the parents care for her as they have vowed to do.  But why does he have to walk away and take her life in the process?<br /><br />Uncle Jack
