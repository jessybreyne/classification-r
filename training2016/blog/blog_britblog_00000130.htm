	 Macro in 1 week
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>Been busy during the past week working on the latest mission impossible - <strong>studying macroeconomics in a week</strong>. Not an easy task considering that I am learning it from scratch plus not bothering to listen what is going on in lectures has made it harder than ever. Hearing an old grandpa trying to put you to sleep with his never ending slides of indirect points and graphs isn't a good way to learn economics considering I never even prepared myself for lectures by at least reading through that big fat book of his (<em>Economics Tenth Edition by Lipsey & Chrystal</em>).<br /><br />Tutorials have been no different. Probably worse as I have to absorb his "speech" by writing at lightning speed which I obviously can't unlike <a href="http://alch84.blog-city.com">DeSalvo</a>. But in a way, it was useful in a way because at least I know that certain terms and graphs exist and also because I can understand some things despite never reading through the book before. All these crazy mad rush was because of an economics test on Tuesday which carries 5% of the year's module. Now, its already Sunday and thankfully, I have already reached exchange rates. But of course I need to read through that damn book all over again to really get hold of what I am reading from GDP to interest rates.<br /><br />Oh well, this is due to a term of messing around and not bothering to be on track for new materials covered daily. And now, after completing 3 horrendous courseworks the previous week, I was given another bonus 4! An economics essay, faim, maths and one more for actuarial methods coming up next week. Plus there will be another one for maths and statistics coming up before the end of term. Also as mentioned, an economics test this Tuesday as well. That is it all of life in university this week and it's getting busier as I am nearing the end of term (again). Also, there is still hope for Liverpool from their midweek resurgence in the Champions League. But of course, the main objective is for a top 4 finish in order to qualify for another adventure in Europe next season.</p>

	 A weekend to forget
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>As the title suggests, it's been a truly disappointing weekend, probably the worst since coming to London. First, Liverpool's dismal performance at St. James Park and today a disastrous football tournament at Latimer Road. "You're not famous anymore!" That was what was aimed at the ever loyal Liverpool fans who travelled to Newcastle. According to reports, it was a surprising dull affair as it is a fixture which usually promises lots of goals and excitement. From what I read, Newcastle fans were talking about Liverpool having a dodgy keeper, and that was in between laughters every time the Liverpool defence panicked and hoofed the ball everywhere.<br /><br />Some said it was one of the worst Liverpool sides in modern football but injuries shouldn't be an excuse considering the size of Liverpool which should mean that there is a quality squad to choose from. Tactically, Milan Baros was isolated up front alone despite running all over the place. It is obvious that Liverpool lacks players who have the quality of beating a man or two as Vladimir Smicer looks like some useless player just like before. Finnan meanwhile could have done it with his Range Rover and Riise looked ineffective despite two exceptional performances a week ago. Pellegrino was exchanging verbals with Scott Carson throughout the game while Jamie Carragher was giving words of encouragement to the nervous keeper.<br /><br />Hyypia meanwhile was as usual rock solid despite some dodgy errors while Biscan couldn't get his magic done today. Luis Garcia? It's unbelievable people compare him with Kenny Dalglish. For Stevie G? Well, as usual he was probably the best performer in the team. What can we do without him and what more can he do for us? How many times has he scored crutial points for us this season already? And what will happen if Gerrard decides to leave? Without him, we won't be where they are now. He should make up his mind now whether he wants to leave or not. Having a captain whose future looks uncertain won't do much good. Either he hands in a transfer request to leave and hand the captaincy to Carragher or he stays a red forever.<br /><br />All in all, it was a bad week for Liverpool and Benitez who can't be put to blame considering such a weak squad he have to work with. One day, we are all fired up and put in a magnificent performance, but the next day we look like we don't seem to bother. Liverpool certainly need loads of cash to build the team and the by the investment comes in, another season would probably be over. It's not that there are no options, there are a few! L4 and Morgan have left the door wide open so what are we waiting for? A club like Liverpool should be aiming higher than the current target of 4th place every season. Where are all the high expectations gone?<br /><br />As for today, probably the worst tournament I've played all my life. The lack of fitness, coordination and teamwork were the killer blows which resulted in us failing to win a single game. Not blaming anyone despite some unfair plays such as late tackles and pulling other people's pants, we looked far from ready for real football. We were so unfit that the players upfront never lasted more than a half. Tactically, we were just knocking the ball around and hoping for a miracle. Not to say the opponents were particularly good today, but I thought we could have got something out of it, at least a win. Well, what is there to play for now? I don't know, probably nothing left this academic year. I shall see what happens in the upcoming tournaments. But, definitely it's not the end of my footballing life. That's for sure!</p>

	 Top frag in snowball fight
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>It’s the time of the year again where hundreds of top class athletes from all over London gather together in the annual London snowball fight. It wasn’t an easy start considering we have to wake up in the early hours in the morning just like dragging ourselves to class. With grounds filled with inch-thick snow, the top participants were all geared up for a battle of supremacy. Favorites of the year included legendary crapper, I mean legendary footballer <a href="http://alch84.blog-city.com">Alvo DeSalvo</a>, defending champion <a href="http://dlch84.blogspot.com">Daniel</a>, the dangerous than ever Sze Chuen, and young rookie Chia Wei.<br /><br />Lots of activity went on during the fight, so only the highlights of the game are going to be mentioned. As the fight begun just after the hour, defending champion Daniel immediately showed his class with an early hit at Chia Wei while Sze Chuen was still lost trying to find his way to the battle point and DeSalvo was still in bed. However, things changed very quickly as more and more people entered the battlefield with young rookie Chia Wei hitting back very quickly. At one time he had 3 consecutive headshots at the defending champion which brought him to the top of the ranking.<br /><br />Then came the ever dangerous Sze Chuen who caught everyone by surprise with 8 hits and overtook the rankings within 2 minutes. The legendary footballer DeSalvo meanwhile had a nightmare day only managing 1 hit in 23 attempts. But as the time draws closer to the finish, Sze Chuen missed a golden chance to seal a victory with an unbelievable miss at point blank range as Chia Wei was down.<br /><br />From no where, the rejuvenated Chia Wei immediately got up and hit Daniel, Sze Chuen and DeSalvo with one throw which brought him on equal hits with Sze Chuen. In the closing moments of the fight, there came DeSalvo who attacked Daniel and Sze Chuen with 2 headshots in one throw which meant that DeSalvo wouldn’t finish last. Being distracted and dizzy from the headshot, Sze Chuen couldn’t recover in time and Chia Wei quickly hit yet another headshot at him to seal the victory in magnificent style.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/P3040003.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/P3040003.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Early morning snow...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/DSCN0712.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/DSCN0712.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Destination of battle...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/P3040005.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/P3040005.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Daniel making his mark...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/DSCN0709.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/DSCN0709.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Warming up for a throw...<br /><br />Note: No offence to Alvin, Daniel or Sze Chuen.</p>

	 Futbol in the snow
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>My illustrious career in football has finally reached yet another milestone. Those were the days where I used to watch Premier League or Serie A matches where players like McManaman and Del Piero were running around with snow falling over their head and body, never ending steam coming out of their body and nonetheless still making those runs up and down the field. Now the reality has arrived.<br /><br />2 weeks in a row, playing real football under heavy snow brought me back to my childhood dreams years ago. Yes, it was never easy with never ending snow falling all over my head and body, reduced vision caused by the snowfall and hands and legs totally frozen until it almost couldn't move. But as usual, it was definitely an enjoyable afternoon (maybe because I didn't make a fuss about the teams). A couple of highlights of the game includes my man of the match performance and hat-trick(or maybe its 4 goals), the absolute hunk coming 5 minutes before we were suppose to finish and the poor opponent keeper frozen out in the cold.<br /><br />Anyway, on a more serious note, there is a football tournament coming up this Saturday, so obviously I am battling to get fit. Study wise, been really busy this week with 3 pieces of coursework due and also a couple more on the way. Chelsea, led by Jose-de-moron-ho were all but lucky to win the Carling Cup. No matter how much success the moron can bring in, they will lose it all one day. That shall be the time when people will respect the rise of the greatest club of all time! As they say, a wounded tiger is more dangerous. So, beware the wounded tiger!</p>

	 Headshot-ed yet again
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>Not the first time, it's been yet another disastrous stats quiz. Following previous tragedies, I planned to use a new tactic this time and that is <em>do not study before the quiz</em>. It almost paid off though if I was not half asleep and was aware that he (Dr. Gerrard) was camping at the corner there. Well, despite 11 hours of sleep under my belt instead of the usual 2.5 hours of cs a night, I still felt half asleep in class, maybe it's because i'm still asleep. Some said that I did not have enough training of cs and hence I was lacking practice for it. NO MAN!!! It does not work this way!!! Anyway, unlike before, it wasn't that disastrous though, just some really stupid mistakes even a high school student can detect.<br /><br />Poisson <strong>NOT</strong> Normal...<br />Ho: u=4.5<br />H1: u<3<br />Under Ho, X~Po(4.5), Reject Ho if X<3<br />P(Type I error)=P[Reject Ho l Ho is true]<br />                            =P[X<3 l u=4.5]<br />                            =<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">P[Z< (3-4.5)/√(4.5)]</span></strong><br />                            =0.2398<br />Why man!!! WHY??????????????<br />Same with part (b) of that question which is worth 4 marks out of 10!!! The other question was due to my lack of intelligence where I forgotten to divide by Px(x). This means that the time is approaching where I have to draw a line to CS. The time has come, the end is near. NO MORE MAN!!! NO MORE!!! Daniel, you are the new server. Do your job well ok? I will pay you people a visit when I am up to date on studies.</p>

	 The Great London Snow
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>It was 4pm (GMT) on a Monday afternoon when I was walking out of lectures after seeing stars all over the room during the 2 hours of Financial Maths. Stepping out of the university building, there were droplets of water falling from the sky as it seems to be a potential heavy downpour which would probably dominate the entire evening. But as I look in the distance, my eyes suddenly lost sight of the stars which I saw without a telescope in the last 2 hours. Instead, I could see autumn leaves falling from the sky, but it seems to be white in colour.<br /><br />As I look properly and more carefully, those white autumn leaves were actually small chunks of ice flakes, just like what I see before eating my ice kacang on a hot Sunday afternoon back home in Malaysia. Despite standing in the shade, the strong winds blew those flakes of ice over to me. Not long after, my jacket seem to be partially covered in those ice which I saw falling from the sky. I then learnt that those pieces of ice are called "snow".<br /><br />But the greed in me was inevitable, I wanted more of it! It wasn't long before my wish came true as heavy balls of snow started falling from the sky assisted with tornado winds blowing at the speed of light. As I looked around me, people were all running for their life to safety, whilst cars were at limiting equilibrium almost ready for take off. Being the odd one out in the open, I had to make one quick dash through the storm against the mighty winds and heavy snow fall to the entrance of the university building knowing its going to be a make-or-break attempt.<br /><br />To my relief, I managed to hang on to the entrance door of the building after making a tremendous 7.2 metre jump against the winds. Being assisted by a couple of my friends <a href="http://alch84.blog-city.com">Alvin</a>, <a href="http://dlch84.blogspot.com">Daniel</a> and Sze Chuen, they managed to overpower the winds and dragged me into safety. Sigh, what a relieve otherwise I would be probably be stuck in between some buildings. In the end, we all managed to make our way to class despite being 5 minutes late.</p>

	 The Start of a New Beginning
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>After half a year in university enjoying life and the English weather which resulted in virtually no work done other than those weekly groceries shopping and laundry, it's about time to start a new beginning and that means it's time to take out the books for some serious work to be done. Already one term gone last year and one progress test earlier in January for which I only had hours of CS under the belt, things has gone really bad. Gone are the days where I used to attempt questions during the interval break between lectures and also attending lab sessions. But after all these disastrous moments which I consider it to be history, it's well time for a new beginning.<br /><br />Starting a new beginning ain't easy, it's not getting it done overnight or over the week. But as of today (17th February 2005), I will change my lifestyle and that includes sacrificing various of my favorite past times and less loitering around. So, amongst the things I will do to "<em>turn over a new leaf</em>" (famous quote from <a href="http://alch84.blog-city.com">Alvo DeSalvo</a>), are:<br /><ol><li>Compulsory daily revision of at least 2 hours of the day's work in lectures and if possible previous work done during the past week or month. </li><li>Suspending all computer games until the summer when exams are all over (doesn't apply to CS - see point 3).</li><li>Limiting to a maximum of <strong>2 hours a day </strong>of CS (reduced from the previous number of 3).</li><li>Compulsory Saturday night group study (if people turn up) or private study.</li><li>Cutting off all clubbing and drinking sessions until all work is up to date.</li><li>Reducing MSN chat time to a maximum of 1 hour a day.</li><li>No more music while studying (although techno helps me in doing maths).</li><li>Have good sleeping hours (ie no less than 8 hours a day).</li></ol><p>Anyway, that shall do for an all new beginning. Note that cutting down football time is not one of the options to sacrifice in my life to drive for success. That shall do for the moment. </p></p>

	 New Year in London
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>After confusing loads of people in the last post with various statistical principles, and being untruthful in the one before about road crossing, maybe it's time for some <strong>Real</strong> stuff (ie not Imaginary). Anyway, New Year in London was equally just as fun as back home although there were lots of things missing. NO relatives, angpau's, yee sang, gambling (so far), never ending road journeys up North and down South of Malaysia, holidays (other than those self-declared ones), but other than that, there seem to be anything else in London. Yeah, and that includes Lion Dances, New Year songs, Chinatown celebrations which was the biggest I've ever seen, and also a steamboat dinner on the first day. Here are some pictures of the Wednesday night steamboat:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/DSCN0688.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/DSCN0688.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />All our food ready to be cooked...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/HPIM0249.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/HPIM0249.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Eating time...<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/640/DSCN0700.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #006600 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #006600 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #006600 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/174/3251/400/DSCN0700.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Yaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmm............

	 New Year and its superstitions
	 
    </h3>
    
     
    <p>First of all, 恭喜发财 and Happy New Year to you all. As you people know, for every New Year in the Chinese calendar, there exists infinitely many superstitions such as no sweeping floors on the first day of new year. In the modern world, most people certainly wouldn't believe in these so called nonsense anymore. However, they seem to be making the wrong choice. After years of sacrifice for this wonderful discovery of the proof of the superstition, I finally came up with a solution for it. Here it goes:<br /><br /><em>Some useful symbols and its meanings:</em><br />P(A l B)=Probability of A occuring given B occured<br />U=Or<br />X'=X NOT occuring<br />.......=Do until<br /><em></em><br /><em>Let:</em><br />X=Doing something wrong on the first day of New Year (eg washing hair)<br />Y=Something bad happens (eg losing money in gambling)<br /><br />Assuming that it occurs at <em>random</em>,<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn)=A1<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn-1)=A2<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn-2)=A3<br />........<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn l X')=An<br /><br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn-1 l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn)=B1<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn-1 l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn-1)=B2<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn-1 l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn-2)=B3<br />........<br />P(Y1 U Y2 U Y3 U ... U Yn-1 l X')=Bn<br /><br />........<br /><br />P(Y1 l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn)=Z1<br />P(Y1 l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn-1)=Z2<br />P(Y1 l X1 U X2 U X3 U ... U Xn-2)=Z3<br />........<br />P(Y' l X')=Zn<br /><br />After the years of research, taking a <em>random</em> sample of 63 people, i had the following results:<br />X0=18, X1=14, X2=11, X3=9, X4=7, X5=4<br />Y0=24, Y1=19, Y2=12, Y3=5, Y4=3<br />Using my mathematical capability, I calculated the probabilities of those infinitely many possible events occuring (including those that are not in the random sample) and came up with a solution that:<br /><strong>A1>B1>...>Z1>A2>B2>...>Z2>A3>B3>...>Z3>..........>An>Bn>...>Zn=0</strong><br />and hence it concludes that the more wrong things that you do in the new year, the more bad luck you will get. Don't believe me? Try to prove it yourself. Anyway, Happy New Year again!!!<br /><br />Note: The above proof was NO copyright of any historical scientist.<br /></p>
