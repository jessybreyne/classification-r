<div class="storycontent">	<p>Good news: I&#8217;m currently featuring in a two-page <a href="http://www.nike.com/acg">Nike ACG</a> ad that&#8217;s running in a number of magazines (Men&#8217;s Health, FHM, Men&#8217;s Fitness, etc, etc).</p>
	<p>Bad news: I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint, but it&#8217;s not actually Nike gear that I&#8217;m wearing in the photo. In fact, I&#8217;m <a href="/blogpix/acg_ad.jpg">not wearing anything at all</a>. I&#8217;m really sorry, mum!

<div class="feedback">&nbsp;4th March 2005</div>
<div class="storycontent">	<p><img src="http://www.bensaunders.com/blogpix/whitepod.jpg" class="left" alt="View of the Swiss Alps" />The good news: I spoke at an event for the Discovery Channel last night, but it was about as far removed from the usual hotel conference centre as you can get - the venue was the breathtaking <a href="http://www.whitepod.com">Whitepod</a> &#8216;eco camp&#8217; in the Swiss Alps (see wobbly cameraphone shot). It was a very intimate event, with a fantastic mix of (mostly Scandinavian) guests and by the time I did my bit in the evening, it felt like I was addressing a bunch of friends. I was booked on an early flight from Geneva back home this morning and I was treated to a high-speed dawn skidoo ride to meet a waiting taxi further down the valley. (Cue James Bond fantasies of ducking bullets, skydiving off cliffs and yanking open Union Jack parachutes&#8230;)</p>
	<p>The bad news: I didn&#8217;t actually get to sleep in one of the Whitepods - they were all full and I crashed out on some sofa cushions, on the floor of the chalet next door. I have a stinking cold, I&#8217;ve nearly lost my voice, the flight home was delayed for ages and when we did get airborne, it was full of screaming kids and the soggy bacon and egg &#8216;panini&#8217; we were served gave me flashbacks from our journey through Siberia last spring. The Bond fantasy didn&#8217;t last long.

<div class="feedback">&nbsp;2nd March 2005</div>
<div class="storycontent">	<p>I&#8217;ve just got back from speaking at <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> in Monterey, California, and <em>what</em> an event it was. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever met such an incredible community of people under the same roof, and I can&#8217;t imagine that there&#8217;s anything quite the same anywhere else on the planet. The awesome <a href="http://www.poptech.com">Pop!Tech</a> came close, but the two are very different; Pop!Tech had a cosy, welcoming, laid-back atmosphere whereas at TED I felt a little intimidated by the whole affair when I first turned up.</p>
	<p>The sheer level of intellect, achievement and, well, <em>money</em> that was hovering around was almost overwhelming. The founders of Google, eBay and Amazon.com were there. The co-discoverer of DNA was there. The head of General Motors was there. The creator of The Simpsons was there. U2&#8217;s Bono spoke to the audience (via a very snazzy near-holographic satellite link) for nearly an hour. David Blaine was playing card tricks on guests. And I had to get up and speak to all 1,000 &#8216;TEDsters&#8217; on Thursday afternoon.</p>
	<p>After my 20-minute talk, however, everything changed - like the survivor of a rite of passage, I was sucked right into the heart of TED. My mind is still spinning, but I&#8217;m going to try and pick out a few of the highlights for me over the next few days.</p>
	<p>The first has to be the contrast between the stunning (and often shocking) <a href="http://www.edwardburtynsky.com">photography of Ed Burtynsky</a> and the phenomenal vision, optimism and energy of the designer <a href="http://www.designboom.com/eng/interview/lovegrove.html">Ross Lovegrove</a> and the architect <a href="http://www.mcdonough.com">William McDonough</a>. Sustainability is a bit of a buzzword right now, but the work these visionaries are doing utterly reaffirmed my faith in the human race. Moving stuff indeed, and I now have a few exciting ideas to do with this year&#8217;s expedition bubbling away. I&#8217;ll write more soon.</p>
	<p>Elsewhere, I&#8217;ve just noticed that those fine fellows over at <a href="http://www.stylegala.com">StyleGala.com</a> have included my site in their &#8216;worth a visit&#8217; section - wahey!</p>
	<p>Last but not least, there are some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/TED2005">TED2005 photos on Flickr</a>. There&#8217;s one of me in there somewhere&#8230;

<div class="feedback">&nbsp;24th February 2005</div>
<div class="storycontent">	<p>Oooh mumma. TED kicked off at 2pm today - the first speaker was Nobel Laureate and cracker of the DNA code, <a href="http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1962/watson-bio.html">James Watson</a> and from then until 6:30 the speakers, stories, ideas, concepts and questions came thick and fast - speakers have just 18 minutes each on stage (there are 50 speakers in four days) and there&#8217;s no time for q&amp;a. There are some incredible people here, and the whole event has been slightly surreal so far - I&#8217;ve just got back from a cocktail party at Monterey&#8217;s fabulous aquarium - I was completely zonked with jetlag and hung out with my friend Alex Steffen from <a href="http://www.worldchanging.org">WorldChanging.org</a>.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m a bit miffed that I&#8217;m not feeling on top form. I still have toothache (and an accompanying hamster cheek) and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll clear up before tomorrow - I&#8217;m on stage at three-ish, in the unenviable slot between the hilarious <a href="http://www.zefrank.com">Ze Frank</a> and, er, Bono. I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes and I&#8217;ll endeavour to write a little more about this exceptional event before too long&#8230;
