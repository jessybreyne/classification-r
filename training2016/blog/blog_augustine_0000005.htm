<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99"> BEAUTY HERE AND SOMETIMES THERE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><img src="blogimages/trio.jpg" width="470" height="300" name="trio.jpg" hspace="2"></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I was on the Underground on my 
  way to the Hayward Gallery to see the <i><font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.hayward.org.uk/exhibitions/illusion/" target="_blank">Eyes, 
  Lies &amp; Illusions</a></font></i> exhibition when a father and two little 
  boys got on. The beauty of this trio was such that it seemed to light up the 
  whole carriage. I didn't want to stare and kept surreptitiously glancing from 
  behind my newspaper. To say that they were black says nothing. Their skin was 
  African midnight blueblack, the colour of a starry desert sky and polished as 
  the stones in a clear stream. There was not a hair on their heads or brows. 
  Their smooth hairlessness and the extraordinary intensity and innocence of their 
  eyes made them seem like beings from another planet. The man was dressed in 
  a light-coloured tracksuit but the boys, under their black casual jackets, wore 
  formal white shirts and white trousers. My sketch from memory does not do them 
  justice. If I had brought my camera I would have asked permission to photograph 
  them. Sometimes life generously offers you a brief encounter with absolute beauty 
  to remind you that all is not lost and ugliness can never entirely take over 
  the world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">The Hayward exhibition was another 
  kind of beauty. It is based on the collection of <a href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/exh_gfx_en/ART24467.html" target="_blank">Werner 
  Nekes</a>, German experimental film-maker and media researcher, and includes 
  over a thousand images, early optical instruments, devices, games, illusions, 
  as well as work by some contemporary artists who explore optical phenomena. 
  There is even a room-size <a href="http://brightbytes.com/cosite/what.html" target="_blank">camera 
  obscura</a> set up on the roof of the gallery where you can see an upside down, 
  moving image of the South Bank - no electronics, simply a very small hole in 
  the wall and the principle known since the 5th century BC:<br>
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#999999"><i>Light travels in a straight 
    line and when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through 
    a small hole in thin material they do not scatter but cross and reform as 
    an upside down image on a flat surface held parallel to the hole.</i> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I love it to bits, all of it, 
  especially the wonderfully ingenious and gorgeous to look at early optical devices, 
  and the engravings of such inventions. No Olympic-size techno fair displaying 
  the latest computers (upgraded ten minutes later) can compete, in my eyes, with 
  one room full of lovingly conceived, crafted, polished and built-to-last-forever 
  magical instruments which expand your mind and thrill your senses. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> To conclude my Name the Gnovel 
  Competion<i>,</i> I cannot resist quoting from <a href="http://ivyai.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ivy</a>'s 
  lovely e-mail response to her runner-up prize, <font color="#FFCC99"><i><a href="tradeds2.html">Augustine's 
  True Confession</a></i></font>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><i>&quot;...The book itself 
    is a wonder. Thinking about the format, of what it would be like presented 
    as straight prose, I think I would not have found it so compelling as I did. 
    The white space, the movement, the way my eyes were pulled in every direction 
    provided relief and dynamism at the same time...&quot;</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> ( Just in case you hadn't noticed, 
  this book can be <a href="tradeds2.html">ordered</a> from me).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">On Sunday I'm going to Paris 
  for a week so no blogging until November 1 or 2...eek! US election day! Let 
  us pray. And vote, if you are American and want your country back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99">AND THE WINNER IS......</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Me! Last night I thought of 
  a title for the gnovel, which I'm going to hang on to for the time being: <font color="#FFCC99"><i>DOUBLE 
  ENTENDRE</i><font color="#99CCFF">. It has the right sound, the right risqu&eacute; 
  connotation, and the idea that more than one level is involved. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">However, I'm going to award the 
  prize to the runner-up, the one who came closest to hitting the target. And 
  that was...drum roll..... poet par excellence <a href="http://ivyai.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ivy</a>, 
  for her suggestion: <font color="#FFCC99"><i>Beside Herself</i><font color="#99CCFF">. 
  Take a bow Ivy and let me know where to mail your prize.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Big thanks to the rest of you 
  who responded to my short-lived challenge and provided enough great titles for 
  a shelf of as-yet unwritten books. Maybe you could get started on some of them?</font></p>

  you suggest a title for my <a href="blaugarchive.html">gnovel </a>? Come up 
  with one that I can use, something catchy and relevant, and I will send you 
  a prize - a signed, free copy of <font color="#FFCC99"><i><a href="tradeds2.html">Augustine's 
  True Confession</a></i><font color="#99CCFF">!! So far I've rejected two banal

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Here's a mini-version of the 
  latest image to be added.<i> </i>There's more on the drawing board and I'm getting 
  nearer to the stage when I can send a chunky section to a publisher with the 
  aim of getting a contract to finish the book. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I find it hard to summarise verbally 
  what this gnovel is about though I know it in my head and heart. There are two 
  distinct ways of thinking and seeing running in counterpoint, like a musical 
  composition. In fact I see it in those terms: there's Ottoline's voice, Augustine's 
  voice, plus the voice of an unseen narrator. The readers' eyes move from one 
  to the other in the same way that you can hear the separate parts in a madrigal 
  without losing a sense of the whole.</font></p>
