          it got worse.My first day back at work i lost her profile web page so i went to google typed in her name and found.. a blog. She was counting down her days till she killed herself on her birthday - believing that she was useless, loverless and job less. She was 'fed up with being a survivor'.That night i drove to her houseÂ  - unsu<P>
