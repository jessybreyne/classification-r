I have 
handed 
over 
my 
baby, 
<A href="bloggersparliament.html" target="_blank">Bloggers 
Parliament,</A> 
to 
its 
current 
members. 
No, 
it 
is 
not 
a cowardly 
thing 
to 
do. 
Like 
others 
who 
resign 
from 
Parliamentary 
duties 
in 
the 
real 
world 
to 
&quot;spend 
more 
time 
with 
their 
families&quot; 
I have 
realized 
that 
I owe 
it 
to 
my 
muse 
to 
pay 
more 
attention 
to 
her 
than 
to 
anything 
else. 
Who 
is 
my 
muse? 
It's 
not 
who 
you 
think 
it 
is. 
My 
muse 
is 
me 
and 
I am 
she. 
When 
I neglect 
her 
to 
busy 
myself 
with 
worldly 
matters, 
she 
turns 
into 
Natalie 
and 
I disappear 
into 
the 
mist. 
This 
cannot 
be 
allowed. 
So, 
dear 
baby 
BP, 
you 
don't 
need 
me 
anymore. 
Sob 
quietly. 
Go 
to 
your 
new 
family 
who 
will 
look 
after 
you 
and 
feed 
you 
with 
new 
ideas 
and 
new 
purpose. 
I will 
watch 
over 
you 
from 
the 
sidelines 
and 
perhaps, 
now 
and 
then, 
venture 
a comment. 
But 
you're 
on 
your 
own 
now.

To 
cool 
down 
and 
create 
a soothing 
atmosphere 
before 
I launch 
into 
this 
teeth-clenching 
tale, 
here 
is 
the 
view 
from 
my 
front 
window 
as 
night 
begins 
to 
fall 
here 
in 
London. 
It 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
subject 
of 
this 
post, 
which 
is 
below 
the 
picture.

<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Last 
month, 
anxious 
about 
all 
the 
viruses 
going 
round, 
I decided 
my 
Mac 
needed 
more 
protection 
from 
the 
evil 
alien 
bugs. 
I already 
had 
up 
to 
date 
Norton 
Anti-Virus 
and 
Norton 
Utilities 
but 
I wanted 
their 
new 
<A href="http://www.symantec.com/region/reg_eu/product/nis_mac_index.html" target="_blank">Internet 
Security 
3.0</A> 
package 
which 
includes 
firewall. 
So 
I go 
to 
the 
main 
Symantec 
website, 
as 
one 
does, 
expecting 
to 
download 
this 
software 
directly. 
No 
way! 
As 
a Mac-using 
outcast 
(and 
still 
stubbornly 
on 
OS9.2) 
how 
could 
I presume 
to 
be 
allowed 
a simple 
download? 
I must 
order 
it 
by 
post 
from 
U.S.A. 
Punished 
but 
determined, 
I go 
to 
the 
ordering 
page. 
There 
I am 
asked: 
how 
do 
I want 
the 
package 
to 
be 
sent, 
by 
FedEx? 
Or 
by 
FedEx? 
A mere 
&quot;airmail&quot; 
option 
is 
not 
available. 
I think: 
well, 
it's 
only 
a small 
lightweight 
CD, 
how 
much 
can 
FedEx 
charge 
to 
deliver 
that? 
$42.95 
that's 
how 
much. 
The 
software 
is 
$69.95. 
Swallowing 
my 
outrage, 
I sign 
away 
$112.90. 
Wait: 
this 
is 
not 
the 
end 
of 
the 
story. 
A few 
days 
later, 
a very 
large 
box 
is 
delivered 
to 
my 
door 
by 
FedEx. 
I sign 
for 
it 
(unsuspecting), 
open 
wasteful 
wrappings 
and 
install 
the 
software; 
it 
seems 
to 
do 
its 
job. 
About 
ten 
days 
later, 
I get 
a bill 
from 
FedEx 
for 
&pound;16.12 
(about 
$30) 
for 
&quot;administration 
fee&quot; 
and 
V.A.T. 
That's 
when 
I blow 
a gasket. 
I write 
righteous 
anger-filled 
letters 
to 
both 
Symantec 
and 
FedEx, 
berating 
them 
for 
their 
deviousness, 
greed 
and 
downright 
deception. 
Do 
I get 
abjectly 
apologetic 
replies 
and 
cancellation 
of 
this 
extra 
charge? 
No. 
I get 
standard 
form 
letters 
basically 
saying 
it's 
all 
my 
fault. 
And 
if 
I want 
to 
return 
the 
software 
for 
refund, 
I'm 
told 
it 
won't 
be 
accepted 
if 
I've 
opened 
it. 
This 
is 
*ten 
days* 
after 
delivery 
and 
of 
course 
they 
know 
I will 
have 
bloody 
opened 
and 
installed 
it 
and 
that 
they 
will 
therefore 
refuse 
a refund. 
Now, 
am 
I paranoid 
to 
think 
that 
Symantec 
and 
FedEx 
are 
in 
cahoots 
on 
a nice 
little 
extra 
earner 
for 
them 
both?</FONT></P>

my 
digital 
camera 
to 
participate 
in 
this 
project 
to 
document 
the 
undocumentable. 
If 
you 
focus

at 
all, 
any 
detail 
of 
the 
flotsam

jetsam

your 
everyday

just 
randomly 
wandering 
around, 
you 
collect 
jewels. 
Random 
jewels, 
fragments 
of 
the 
marvellous. 
It's 
all 
beautiful, 
all 
of 
it, 
stunningly 
so. 
Even 
the 
detail 
within 
the 
detail 
is 
beautiful. 
Extraordinary 
bits 
of 
a magic 
carpet 
that 
stretches 
to 
eternity. 
After 
lining 
up 
the 
pieces, 
I gave 
them 
a twist

motion. 
The

I'm

<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Too 
much 
to 
do, 
too 
little 
done, 
too 
many 
ideas, 
I keep 
hopping 
from 
one 
to 
the 
other 
like 
a demented 
grasshopper, 
but 
slower. 
Hop...hop........h...o...p. 
One 
of 
those 
hops 
produced 
a <A href="blaugarchive.html">new 
panel 
</A>for 
the 
gnovel. 
One 
measly 
panel. 
Allright, 
it 
took 
quite 
a long 
time 
even 
though 
it 
looks 
quite 
small 
over 
there. 
What 
the 
heck, 
I'm 
going 
to 
put 
it 
here 
<I>as 
well 
</I>as 
where 
it 
belongs 
and 
I'll 
make 
it 
bigger<I>. 
</I> 
You 
still 
have 
to 
go 
to 
the 
gnovel 
to 
see 
the 
bottom 
half 
of 
it.
