      no bad news today, please.</span><br />
      I am so fucking discouraged that I just don't know what to do. <br /><br />1. I can't fucking enjoy my spring break because that asshole math teacher assigned a test during it.  What the fuck good is a spring break if I've got this shit hanging over my head? <br /><br />2. My mother is treating me like I'm insane for trying to take in my grandmother's cat.  Mother hates cats, and I really think that she'd just as soon kill it than anything.<br /><br />3. My house is a fucking disaster.  I don't know when I'm going to have time to clean it, but I've got to get all my clothes put away before I try to introduce the two cats to one another.  What if one (or both!) of them starts spraying or something?<br /><br />4. I'm going to have to take that test tomorrow, if it's going to get done this week at all.  I don't even know what all the words mean, though.  I've got to know how to find a vertical amplitode or asymptode or something.  Half the time, it sounds like the instructor is saying assy toad.  Which pretty much describes him to a T.<br /><br />5. I just found out that all of the forms that I've put online for reimbursement to the invited guests we had in town last month are wrong.  I did them per the instructions of a guy that I (usually) trust in Travel Accounting, but his boss (I guess that is who she is) is giving me shit about them.  Now I'm going to have to contact all of these people again and get their home addresses.  Nothing makes a good impression like repeated requests for information due to lack of communication at my institution. <br /><br />6. I'm going to have to take back the damn new tanning lotion that I bought the other day.  It makes me stink, kind of like burnt chemicals. <br /><br />7. I played a little bit of hookie this morning and went to the Crate & Barrel outlet on the corner to try to find some open-stock flatware to bring to my office.  I feel so wasteful using plasticware every day & throwing it out.  (But I don't believe that you can get plasticware clean enough to use twice, so I throw.)  I asked the woman working there if they had open stock flatware, and she said "No, Dear." in a very condescending way.  I think that she looked down on me* for only buying $1.62 worth of stuff.  (Three tealight holders!  Super cute!  For the top of my TV!) <br />(*probably not.  it was probably just a combination of snooty shop girl & my overwhelming sense of despair making me take it too personally.  still.  feh.)<br /><br />8. I am definitely switching tanning places.  But what a hassle.  I'm just not happy with the experience that I'm having there. <br /><br />9. All in all, I'm not sure that tanning is even for me.  My torso is much darker than my arms & legs.  My hoo-ha is getting a tan.  That's weird.  Also, I've got arm-fat tan lines.  Sexy.  (only, not.)  And, stretch marks do not tan.  I will never understand why people willingly get pregnant.  I tried to do the stand-up bed the other day, but that sucked.  I did not like that.  I had to try to hold the goggles on my face with my hands, and consequently kept sticking my elbow through the grate & touching the bulbs.  Those fuckers get hot!  Anyway.  I'm going to give another place a try & see how it goes.<br /><br />10. <span style="font-size:78%;">I'm really scared about my grandmother.  What on earth am I going to do if she doesn't make it?</span> <br /><br />11. My mom is actually acting really weird in a lot of ways lately.  I think that she might be having problems with her marriage.  I'm not entirely sure.  They just spend so much time together, it's really kind of gross.  And they keep picking at each other about what food they eat.  They're doing some weightwatchers/personal trainer thing or something.  I'm not even sure.  He's losing weight faster than she is, and I kind of think that it's causing a strain.  Or something.  Whatever it is, they're grossing me out. <br /><br />12. My son ran up $228 in long distance on my grandparents home phone line, calling that nasty hootchie in new mexico.  He's selling his go-cart to pay for it.  I'm not sure that he understands why doing this is wrong in the first place. <br /><br />13. I'm going to have to put the vet bill on one of the credit cards that I just paid down. <br /><br />14. It's raining and gloomy and cold and I just want to go home.<br /><br />15. I found reviews of my apartment complex on apartmentreviews.com, and most of them were awful.  It seems that my apartments are known for break-ins, even on the second floor, by the people that live in the government housing around the corner/across the street.  (I'm not sure which complexes are gov't housing.)  Now I'm paranoid. <br /><br />I want to go back to bed.<br />

      so, damn.</span><br />
      So far tonight, I have talked to<br />Grandmommie (2x)<br />Mother (2x)<br />Carol<br />Jennifer<br />the ACLU<br /><br />Also:<br />worked until nearly 7<br />went to Sam's for salad fixins.  (was sorely disappointed to find no spinach or ripe avocados)<br />made salad<br />was disappointed in salad, due to horrific pre-packaged guacamole that I subbed for rock-hard avocados<br />made beef fajita quesadilla<br />finally ate dinner<br /><br />did not:<br />go to Dallas CAT meeting (after learning it started at 5:30 rather than 6:30.  did ask to remain on email list.)<br />clean my house in anticipation of high-anxiety cat introductions<br />do homework<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think that I'm going to get this homework done in any kind of timely fashion.  I've done one section (of four) and it took me about 4 hours to do it.  That is so fucking discouraging.  The only redeeming thing here is that I get to drop one exam grade.  Of course, I'm teetering on the edge anyway, so fuck a duck.<br /><br />sigh.<br /><br />My mother is being kind of a shit about loaning me the kennel to use during cat introductions, but they are at least going to let me use it.  That will save me some expense. <br /><br />I've really got to get my apartment picked up before I try this.  I've got shit strewn everywhere.  My apartment today looks like my room did while I was growing up.  Clothes remain where I was standing when I removed them, paper is piled everywhere, and my bed is never ever made.  The state of my place bothers me, but apparently not enough to motivate me to do anything about it.  I've always been this way, for real.  I'll go through sporadic bouts of organization, but it never lasts long. <br /><br />The thing is, I've got to get all my stuff up and put away before I bring that new cat in.  What if it freaks both of them out and they start retaliatory peeing? <br /><br />Christ. <br /><br />I think I'll go to bed now.<br />

      christ almighty</span><br />
      I had a huge post, but lost it because something has gone horribly wrong with the power jack on my laptop, and the battery is just plain shot. Brilliant of me to decide to put off buying a new laptop. It's not beeping when it comes unplugged anymore. I just have to watch the little light and see if it starts blinking. fun.<br /><br />In short:<br />I spent the whole weekend at my grandparents' house. I didn't intend to do that, and so didn't take my homework. Which means that I got no homework done. sigh.  Still, though, I'd do it all again because my grandmother really needed me.  She'd had a horrible night Friday night, and was kind of getting into a tizzy again Saturday night.  At first she told me to go on home, then she dozed off and woke up in a bit of a panic and was all "But you said you're staying the night, right?"  Yeah, I'm staying.  She said that she slept better last night than she has the whole time she's been sick.  So that was good news. <br /><br />I'm thinking about switching to a different tanning place. I think that they don't change the bulbs often enough where I'm going. Tonight 2 bulbs in the top of the bed didn't come on for a couple minutes. Which is not great. When I got out of there it didn't feel like I'd tanned at all. Palm Beach Tan is a little further away from my house, but they also have locations in Arlington, so it'd be convenient when I'm over there helping my grandparents out.<br /><br />In other news, I am also thinking about bringing my grandparents' cat here. I've been thinking about getting a new cat, this cat needs a home. She's really sweet, too. Now if I can just convince Polly that it's a good idea. heh. Plus, Tiger (oi) is a few years old, and it's harder to place an older cat. Now, I just need to get her to my vet and get her checked out. So long as she doesn't have some sort of communicable disease that will harm Polly I'm going to give it a shot. I'm going to trim both of their nails before I introduce them to one another.   I kind of wish that I still knew Stacey.  She brought new cats into her one bedroom apartment all the time.  Everything that I can find on the web says to keep them separated for days or weeks.   I'm not real sure how to do that when I've only got one room wiht a door on it.  I mean, the bathroom is not good, the closet is not good, the laundry room is tiny.  I'd rather have a litter box in the laundry room than in the closet, though.  hm. <br /><br />Finally, I RSVP'd to attend the Dallas Choice Action Team meeting tomorrow. Activism! Yay! b<br />

      one thing that i miss</span><br />
      It's time for our annual trip to Galveston.  The weather's beautiful and I don't have anyone to camp with. <br /><br />My son is more of a hotel kind of person.  He does not enjoy roughing it.  Not that my version of camping is roughing it at all, but still.  I'm going to have to make more money to afford a hotel trip. <br /><br />Of course, this way I can have a vacation in which I don't spend the majority of the time trying to keep John sober enough to have fun.<br />

      I bow to the wisdom</span><br />
      of <a href="http://manoloshoes.blogspot.com/2005/03/interview-with-miuccia.html">The Manolo</a><br /><em>The grown up peoples they require the grown up clothes. </em><br /><em></em><br /><em>Do not denigrate the importance of looking "normal". Fashion it is about looking good, not seeking out the look of the abnormal, or the outre, or the purposely ridiculous.</em><br /><em></em><br /><em>Manolo says, the true radical in the serious well-cut, well-tailored clothes is the one whose thoughts, talents, and actions will change the world. The attention-seeking adolescent in the motley clothes of the fool, this person is merely the comedic sideshow.</em><br /><br />as well as the Miuccia<br /><em>With women, the more unhappy they are, the more undressed they are.</em><br /><br />These are two ideas that I have been attempting to articulate for some time now. <br /><br />In other news, I am having lunch with Annette today!  yay!<br />

      brilliant!</span><br />
      I didn't go buy a heating pad last night as I'd planned.  (stupid weirdo massage therapist)  Instead I went to the West End Pub with my girlfriends from class and had three pints of Guinness and a corned beef sandwich. <br /><br />hee.<br />

      I'm not having the best time keeping a lid on my emotions today.  I talked to Annette yesterday and my mom last night about how much my grandmother has meant to me throughout my life.  She pretty much raised me, and now she's raising my son.  She's probably the single most important person that I've ever known, and the thought of losing her -really soon- is finally starting to sink in. <br /><br />I've got to go to algebra tonight.  I really don't want to, though.  I hate that class.  And that instructor.<br />
