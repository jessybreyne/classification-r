		<p>I thought I&#8217;d killed my mini iPod, it just froze up and crashed with the back light still on.</p>
	<p>Took me a while to find the solution, so here it is if you&#8217;ve found my blog via google&#8230;</p>
	<p>1. Put mini iPod on hold.<br />
2. Turn hold off.<br />
3. Press and hold menu, whilst holding the select (middle) button.<br />
4. Wait for 6 - 10 seconds<br />
5. mini iPod should reset, then show the Apple logo<br />
6. You&#8217;ve just resurrected your mini iPod.

<div class="post-content">
		<p>Hey. I haven&#8217;t updated my blog properly for a while - this week has just been so, so stressful. I&#8217;m trying to pinpoint the exact cause of the stress. So far I blame the evil tie. It all started on Wednesday.</p>
	<p><strong>Wednesday 2nd March 2005</strong><br />
In class support wasn&#8217;t on, because the class had an exam. Why did no one tell me this? I could have had an extra 3 hours sleep (which I needed badly). I waste about an hour going to school, sitting through tutorial, only to come back straight after.</p>
	<p>Sixth form council meeting at lunchtime. what a load of crap. no one listens to you. nothing gets done. there&#8217;s not time to even eat (perhaps that&#8217;s just as well, I have really bad toothache).</p>
	<p>We&#8217;ve moved floors at work. now I&#8217;m even higher up, so in the event on an emergency or terrorist attack - this has increased my chances of dying significantly. I don&#8217;t like my new desk, it is too &#8216;curvy&#8217;. There is too much legroom. The TV&#8217;s are in awkward positions. The remote controls don&#8217;t work, so I&#8217;m subjected to Sky News (basically - adverts, adverts, adverts, adverts, news, adverts, adverts, repeat).</p>
	<p>The people who work on the desks during the day unplug the entire headset phone cable thing, making it difficult to plug your own headset in without looking around everywhere for the cable to make it fit into the RJ11 port on the phone. However, most importantly, there is no vending machine. I can&#8217;t cope under these conditions.</p>
	<p>The metro was delayed on the way to work. Luckily I drove with my mum to the Metro station, so I was able to get a lift to work. Somehow I actually knew how to get there. We got stuck in traffic. I missed the metro on the way back, because I was actually buying a ticket (because I didn&#8217;t get one on the way there - because I got a lift). If I hadn&#8217;t have bought a ticket, I would have caught that Metro. /me hates metro.</p>
	<p>It&#8217;s also snowing. I hate the snow now. It is getting beyond a joke. This is why global warming is good (..only on the conditions that you somehow manage to avoid rising sea levels, dying crops, floods, droughts, etc.). Ideally tropical temperatures in the winter is what we need - but I&#8217;d settle for anything about 15degC. /me hates snow</p>
	<p>oh, and my MSN messages won&#8217;t send - they just all get returned.</p>
	<p>Why does this have to happen, all on the same day? I suppose it&#8217;s kinda good that this &#8216;crap day&#8217; is hopefully only confined to within 24 hours - otherwise I would have a crap week.</p>
	<p><strong>Thursday 3rd March 2005</strong><br />
Thursday was a bad day. It was kind of like the remnants of the previous really bad day. I left my shoes in the back of my mums car, then she went to work. I have no other shoes, other than work shoes and I wouldn&#8217;t wear work shoes to school. I ended up finding a pair of my brothers shoes, which are caked in mud, have holes in the front and to top it off, are way too small for me.</p>
	<p>My feet hurt.</p>
	<p>Thursday night at work was ok, until break-time. My manager bought us doughnuts and normally you would expect the jam from a doughnut to be in the middle. I bit into one, and the jam came squirting out the other side.</p>
	<p>Normally in these situations my tie acts as a form of bib, catching most of the food/drink/whatever. However, I made the unfortunate mistake of wearing the evil tie. The jam went all down my shirt, then ran all the way down my trousers. I tried to clean it up, but it just made it worse. <em>Mental note to self: Never buy Asda doughnuts. In fact - never accept doughnuts from anyone in the future.</em></p>
	<p>I was also on a call to some guy which I&#8217;d accidentally called, due to the really poor quality and out-of-date data I work off. I tried to say &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry for bothering you&#8221; but it came out.. &#8220;I&#8217;m so, so sooo, so, so,<br />
<pause>, urm, so so so, sorr-, so so so so, sorry for bothering you&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know why, I&#8217;d just somehow temporarily developed a serious speech impediment for about 10 seconds.</p>
	<p><strong>Friday 4th March 2005</strong><br />
Today was still just as bad as yesterday. I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>
	<p>Despite trying quite hard at work tonight, I achieved absolutely no recognition for my efforts. I spent ages trying to find the mentioned phone cable, to connect my headset. I also no longer have a locker, instead I have a cupboard which is shared by everyone.</p>
	<p><em>Mental note to self: Never wear the evil tie again</em></p>
	<p>..I hope your weeks been better than mine.</pause>

		<p>I got a mini iPod, whooo! It&#8217;s so cool. iTunes is a bit weird, I don&#8217;t understand why they don&#8217;t just make it so that you can drag and drop the songs into the iPod music folder :S</p>
	<p>If you buy it on the <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukInd">Apple Education site</a> (and your a student), you get about 10% off. It was only £128, compared to the normal price of £139. You can get discounts on iBooks and stuff too.</p>

		<p>I went shopping with my dad in Morrisons today and at the checkouts there was this man with 5 trolleys full of bread&#8230; I knew people wouldn&#8217;t believe me, due to the strange kinda things which I seem to see&#8230; so here&#8217;s the photo from my phone to prove it&#8230; yes, thats all bread&#8230; :-\</p>
	<p><a href="http://blog.iambigred.com/blogimages/bread.jpg"><img src="http://blog.iambigred.com/blogimages/bread.jpg" alt="bread..." /></a></p>
	<p>My dad said <em>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a lot of sandwiches to make there..!&#8221;</em> to him, he just grunted and continued packing his bread into the bags. I really wanted to know why he needed all this bread. Maybe he was addicted to it, he had loads of different varieties.
