Bloggers Wondering What to Blog About</B></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>1. Should <FONT 
color=#ffcc99>I</FONT> blog about what makes <FONT color=#ffcc99>me</FONT> 
angry? <BR>2. Or should <FONT color=#ffcc99>I</FONT> blog about what makes <FONT

color=#ffcc99>I</FONT> blog about what <FONT color=#ffcc99>I</FONT> do and see 
and hear in <FONT color=#ffcc99>my</FONT> day-to-day life? <BR>4. Or should 
<FONT color=#ffcc99>I</FONT> report on what others are doing in their everyday 
lives? <BR>5. Or should <FONT color=#ffcc99>I</FONT> blog about the Meaning of

name=tinyrage.jpg>1. All I have to do is read a newspaper or turn on the TV and 
my rage rises like a rocket and keeps on climbing. And there's enough fuel for a 
daily or even an hourly blogrant. But, I ask myself: am I really a natural-born 
ranter? Isn't my sputtering rather feeble compared to the inspired apocalyptic 
rants being posted by some world class ranters? And I must admit that, alas, 
ranting is not what I'm best at.</FONT></P>

material which I may or may not transform into something which may or may not be 
art - gnovels, paintings, whatever. Not regular blogging material, in other 
words. </FONT></P>

  Everyone in town--and the whole state--knows that I am against the occupation

  Last week, it was announced that the local National Guard unit for 
  northeastern New Mexico, based in the nearby Armory, was being deployed to 
  Iraq early next year. I was not surprised when yellow ribbons immediately 
  sprang up after the press conference. But I was surprised the following 
  morning to hear 75 soldiers singing, shouting and screaming as they jogged 
  down Main Street, passed our St. Joseph's church, back and forth around town 
  for an hour. It was 6 a.m., and they woke me up with their war slogans, chants

name=madrigirls.jpg>To soothe all our fevered brows, anxious and angry minds, 
probably weary limbs and possibly aching hearts, here are two images of beauty 
and solace. The first one is of <A href="http://www.madrigirls.com/" 
target=_blank>The Madrigirls</A>, friends of ours here in London, who are not 
only individually and collectively more talented than anyone has a right to be 
but also drop-dead gorgeous. They are Heloise Pilkington, Alexandra Brown and 
Siobhan Blake and yes, this is an unashamed plug for them, for their voices, 
their performances. Yes they sing madrigals, by Monteverdi, William Byrd, Thomas 
Morley and many more."<I>Part cabaret, part troubadour, part girl band 
glamour..</I>." but always faithful to the music, its tradition and its spirit. 
They're planning to make a record soon but if you happen to be in London on 
December 14th you can come to their <I>Magical Medieval Christmas Bonanza </I>at 
6:30 pm in the beautiful setting of St.Mary-on-Paddington Green, W2, followed by 
eating and drinking and dancing to swinging jazz in a nearby venue. Book tickets 
at their <A href="http://www.madrigirls.com/" target=_blank>website</A> where 
you can also download a few samples of their music.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><I><FONT face=Verdana color=#ffcc99 size=2>PART ONE 
</FONT></I></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=3><FONT face=Verdana 
color=#99ccff size=2>At one point </FONT><FONT size=2>I got stuck in the huge 
crowd at Trafalgar Square, unable to move, so I asked for a hand to scale a wall 
leading to street level. A whole flurry of hands appeared and lifted me up and 
over in an instant - not too hard a task since I am of minimal stature and 
negligible weight. Nevertheless, this spontaneous and cheerful kindness was 
typical of this crowd, this day, this place, this demonstration.<BR><BR>And when 
we began the slow rhythmic countdown: </FONT><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff 
size=2>ten...nine...eight...seven...six...<BR>five...four...three...two..<I>.ONE</I>! 
<BR>and the 18ft Bush effigy was pulled down, the roaring cheer that came from 
all our throats was powerful enough to fly a rocket to the moon. It was not a 
roar of hatred or revenge but one of solidarity, of fellowship, of 
concern.<BR><BR>The cynics and the mockers and the doubters can say what they 
like, but that's what these protests are about: we <I>do</I> care, not just 
about ourselves but about all other humans on this wounded planet. We don't want 
to be forced to hate, to kill, to take.</FONT><FONT size=2> What we are 
symbolically toppling are the lies, the empty words, the blinkered vision, the 
hypocrisy, the hollow men, </FONT><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>like 
that statue</FONT>, <FONT size=2>who rule our world. Not good enough for 
us.<FONT color=#ffcc99> <I>Another world is possible</I><FONT color=#99ccff>. We 
can see it - why can't they? We are living in the future, they are in the past, 
in the eye-for-an-eye world which has made them blind. Don't they know that the 
fine words "Democracy" "Freedom" "Justice" are like sounding brass in their 
mouths? </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>I did take pictures but 
still have my old fashioned camera so it will be a while before they're 
processed. Thousands of people in the demo had their digital cameras and 
camcorders working overtime, and there surely must have been some bloggers among 
them, so all of you in far-off places starved of unofficial images of London 
during the latest demo, try a patient search of blogdom. There are some photos 
at <A href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HLO311/S00158.htm"

src="blog_augustine_0000016_files/noisypalace.jpg" width=300 align=right 
vspace=4 border=1 name=noisypalace.jpg> here is one of them, of the noise 
protest on Wednesday in front of Buckingham Palace. I wasn't at that one. 
Apparently the police got rather over-zealous and there were scuffles. (Dubya 
and his missus didn't hear a thing).</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>At the big march, all the 
policemen I smiled at smiled back at me so sincerely I wished I had brought a 
big tray of coffee and cakes to offer them. <BR><BR>It was a mild, grey, windy 
day when I set out from home around 1pm and took a bus to Warren Street - the 
buses didn't go any further because of the crowds gathering in front of the 
meeting place, London University. I followed the rucksacks into Gower Street 
where large numbers of people were milling about, looking bewildered. Many of 
them started to walk in the wrong direction and I asked a few people why. They 
said the crowd was already so large that the front of the march was blocked. I 
saw some students going into the courtyard of the university and decided to 
follow them. I walked behind a life-size papier maché Dubya puppet who expertly 
led me through university halls, up and down stairs, and finally out of a door 
and directly into Torrington Place. Brilliant. Now I was able to join what 
seemed to be the start of the march but might have been the middle or the tail. 
We were not actually marching yet. This lasted for nearly an hour but the mood 
was good-humoured, villagey, you felt you knew everybody and they knew you. Lots 
of salt &amp; pepper heads, salt heads, and some really<I> </I>old 
one-foot-in-the grave heads, bent over but still believing that <FONT 
color=#ffcc99><I>another world is possible</I></FONT>. I wanted to embrace them 
all. Conversations were started, dropped, started elsewhere, returned to. 
Creative homemade placards were noted, admired or puzzled over: <I>"The 
Lampstands of Revelation Have the Answer: Where Are They?"</I> Huh?<BR><I>"Since 
when is Democracy dropped from the sky?" </I>Right on! An enterprising young pop 
group seized a business opportunity: one of them was jigging to the music and 
waving their CD while another collected the cash. The tune was catchy, something 
to do with peace. </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#ffcc99 size=2><I>PART TWO</I></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>A blackbearded man jostles 
by, shouting into a loudspeaker: "<I>We don't need Parliament! The people are 
the parliament! We need direct democracy!</I>" I almost ask him if he wants to 
join Bloggers Parliament but then I think better of it because he's a bit, erm, 
overwrought.<BR>And finally we're on the move. After a while I can't tell where 
we are - familiar streets are transformed by the river of people flowing through 
them. I like to keep changing in midstream, staying for a while under one banner 
then floating ahead towards another. A few American flags are waving in the 
breeze, some upside down, some covered in slogans, some torn. A tall thin Texan 
stands on Westminster Bridge, hiding his head under a brown paper bag, saying he 
is tired of guilt by association; his message to Bush is "<I>How dare you spill 
so much blood for the sake of a $1.7bn Halliburton contract?</I>" But a serious, 
well-dressed American woman stands quietly defiant, holding a small sign close 
to her chest "<I>I love U George</I>". A lot of people, smiling, take her 
picture. The irony is not lost: we are the protesting minority, she is part of 
the acquiescing majority, yet here we are in our thousands and there she stands, 
alone.<BR><BR>Two or three helicopters have been hovering over the march all 
afternoon and as we head down Whitehall they seem to be closer. But the hooting 
and whistling and booing and chanting as we pass Downing Street drowns out the 
'copters rattle. As the march slowly approaches our destination, Trafalgar 
Square, and more papier maché Bushes go dancing by and the standard <I>"Bush, 
Blair, out out out! " </I>slogans are repeated ad infinitum, I begin to feel 
that it would have been more appropriate if we had all marched in silence, 
dressed in black, carrying as many coffins as the number of those who have been 
killed on "our side" and on "their side" as a direct result of the crusade led 
by Bush, assisted by Blair, to (as Tony put it) "finish the job". How many 
coffins would that have been? And who could do the body-count of all the 
anonymous dead, all those who didn't get and will never get flag-draped coffins, 
or any coffins at all? The growing pile we are creating of nameless bones now 
joining the pile of nameless bones created by Saddam. But he is Evil and we are 
Good so the killing we do is not like the killing he did. After all, there's 
killing and <I>killing</I>, terror and <I>terror</I>. We say we're sorry for 
some of the deaths we cause. Evil Ones are never sorry. That's the big 
difference, right? </FONT></P>

turn on the TV to see the news and there is the horror in Istanbul - another 
tragedy, another list of dead and wounded and weeping and irreparably damaged 
hearts and minds, followed immediately by two men in dark suits reading prepared 
speeches, rehearsed expressions on their bland and famous faces, words about 
"not giving an inch", "responding to violence with violence" (by the way, these 
two men are rumoured to be Christians). And I wonder: do they live in a 
different world from the rest of us?<IMG height=200

suffer from the escalating violence know this, the wise and far-sighted in high 
places and low places know this, schoolchildren who walked out of school to take 
part in the demonstration know this. But those two men behind the microphones, 
and those who applaud their words, do not know 
this.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff

worrying. Will I remain the same humble, unassuming creature when I'm famous? 
No, I won't. I'll point out that fame should have been given to me when I asked 
for it, oh quite a while ago. Now, bah, I can take it or leave it. See, I'm

in London. To anyone reading this who thinks that protesters are anti-Americans 
wrapped in tired old slogans, let me say: think again. And again. Yes, there are 
bound to be some of those in the crowd and no doubt they'll be singled out by 
some in the media who want you to believe that normal, law-abiding, 
American-friendly, apple-pie-eating people do not go on demonstrations - only 
weirdo hippy losers and Commie intellectuals and rabble rousing 
terrorist-supporters go on demos. Well, think again. Think a lot more.

  <P><FONT face=Verdana color=#ccffcc size=2>I didn't add up the millions but if 
  any of you are quick on a calculator, work it out - quite a tidy sum, right? 
  So here's the plan: we - and again I'm talking about the whole damn 
  blogosphere - reply to all these offers and say: "Yes, thanks, we'll take the 
  money and happily give you our bank account details but first we need to have 
  proof that the money exists. So we will meet you somewhere and you can show us 
  confirmation."<BR>On the appointed day a huge flashmob of us arrives at the 
  specified location and calmly demands that the Fraudsters hand over the loot 
  they have offered us. Bewildered and trembling, the scammers have no 
  alternative but to comply, given the staggering number of us resolutely 
  confronting them. And we get the dosh.</FONT><FONT face=Verdana color=#ccccff

  use this money for the good of the whole world.</I> </B>As follows: 
  <BR><I><BR></I><FONT color=#ccffcc>1. We hire a luxury hotel on a remote and 
  stunning tropical island.<BR>2. We charter a fleet of private jets. <BR>3. We

  include a get-together with Osama B.L. and Saddam and <I>their</I> entire

  to resist such an offer. <BR>5. We book a top-notch team of psychotherapists, 
  hypnotists, masseurs and masseuses, motivators and life coaches. <BR>6. 
  Everybody accepts and we fly them out to the island paradise.<BR>7. Once 
  settled in the fabulous surroundings, the guests are gently led by the 
  Motivating Team to a jacuzzi haven: tropical birds, sweet scents, delicious 
  drinks, and the mesmerising voices of the hypnotherapists induce a state of 
  carefree benevolence in all the guests.<BR>8. Hypnotherapeutic jacuzzi

</FONT><B><BR></B></I>Amongst all the trash I have to delete every day before I 
can read my genuine e-mail, there's a lot of spam offering to rid me of spam if 
I will purchase their services. And I ask myself: why in heaven's name should I 
pay for spam-blocking or spam-cleaning when the very existence of spam is a 
crime? A crime like stalking, mugging, obscene phone-calling, assault, robbery, 
invasion of privacy, fraud, etc. They spy on us, steal our e-mail addresses, 
break into our websites, flood our private space with their rubbish. Maybe some 
spam-control systems work fine and maybe spamming will be <A

target=_blank>declared illegal </A>one day. I discovered <A

report spammers, and this <A 
href="http://members.aol.com/emailfaq/mungfaq.html#definition" 
target=_blank>site </A>tells you how to 'mung' or spam-block your e-mail address 
so it can't be harvested. But I've had a more fun idea:</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>What would happen if all 
of us - and I mean hundreds of thousands of bloggers - started making fun of 
spammers, <FONT color=#ffcc66><I>using their own spam, their own 
words</I></FONT>, to laugh them off the net? For one thing, Google and all the 
other search engines would pick up these words from our blogs and that would 
create chaos among the spammers because nobody would know which was their 
product and which our jolly japes. I'd like to hear what other people think: 
could it be a deterrent? I've made an experimental <FONT

</A>gangsters who think I'm an easy touch - they send me offers of billions of 
dollars every day, each with a new see-through tale, a new alias and a new 
country of origin - some are even bringing God into their stories. I imagine 
them sitting around in their ill-gotten villas, competing to see who can come up 
with the best scam, falling off their chairs laughing as they visualise the 
suckers who will line up to offer them full access to their bank accounts. Well, 
bloggers, let's show 'em who has the last laugh, heh heh. Put your creative hats 
on and start recycling spam in amazing new ways. </FONT></P>

members' mini-biographies and photos</A> has been set up and is gradually being 
filled as people slowly send them in, after considerable nagging by N. She gets 
rather irritated when I remind her that if one wants to undertake a major 
project one must expect to both dish out, and endure, some major nagging. Has 
anything of consequence ever been achieved, I point out, without a lot of 
nagging? If it's not nagging or being nagged by other people, it's nagging one's 
self.<BR><BR>So we put on our red Einstein T-shirt <IMG height=364

width=300 align=left vspace=5 name=einstein.jpg>and went to the gym. Let me tell 
you, it takes a lot of self-nagging to achieve this, even though said gym is 
just round the corner and, had we but discipline enough and time, would be a 
piece of cake to attend six mornings a week rain or shine, resulting in a glow 
of well-being emanating from a perfectly toned body. Our gym is not one of those 
posh fitness temples where slim, beautiful people go to sweat seductively in 
their designer gear. Ours is a more proletarian establishment where sweat smells 
sweaty and agonized grunts from massive weight lifters mingles with the pounding 
noise of, what is it? Muzak for gyms? I said to N that our financial problems 
would be solved if we could create one of these noises and sell it to the disco 
industry. You take any random word, preferably <I>BAYBEE</I>, chant it a few 
hundred times whilst repeatedly thumping any handy hard surface, record it with 
some techno tweaking, and Bob's your uncle.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#99ccff size=2>Every so often I'm 
overcome by a feeling that <B><I>everything must change</I></B>. Not so much in 
the outside world (yes, that too) but in me. Then I start clearing out closets, 
bookshelves, drawers, putting things in plastic sacks to take to the charity 
shop. And that's just the externals. I attempt to do the same with whatever 
seems superfluous in me. Can't count the number of times in my life that I've 
decided to start from scratch. This is good. And not so good. It's like being in 
a permanent state of What shall I be when I grow up? No, that's the wrong image. 
It's not about immaturity. It's that you sense the picture is not quite right so 
you keep erasing and erasing. You'll know when it's right but you don't know 
what you know or how to get to that point when you can say yes! that's it! And 
it keeps on changing. <I>Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose</I>. Here's
