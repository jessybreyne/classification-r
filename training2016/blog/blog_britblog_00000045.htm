From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> Technology pages:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Hackers Target U.S. Power Grid</b><br /><br />Hundreds of times a day, hackers try to slip past cyber-security into the computer network of Constellation Energy Group Inc., a Baltimore power company with customers around the country.<br /><br />"We have no discernable way of knowing who is trying to hit our system," said John R. Collins, chief risk officer for Constellation, which operates Baltimore Gas and Electric. "We just know it's being hit."<br /><br />Hackers have caused no serious damage to systems that feed the nation's power grid, but their untiring efforts have heightened concerns that electric companies have failed to adequately fortify defenses against a potential catastrophic strike. The fear: In a worst-case scenario, terrorists or others could engineer an attack that sets off a widespread blackout and damages power plants, prolonging an outage. <br /><br />Patrick H. Wood III, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, warned top electric company officials in a private meeting in January that they need to focus more heavily on cyber-security. <br /><br />Wood also has raised the issue at several public appearances. Officials will not say whether new intelligence points to a potential terrorist strike, but Wood stepped up his campaign after officials at the Energy Department's Idaho National Laboratory showed him how a skilled hacker could cause serious problems.</i></blockquote>

Some wonderful facts taken from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A413911" target="">this H2G2 article on Kensal Green Cemetery</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The cemetery is also the resting place for several eccentrics peculiar to the British Isles. The first of these is Dr James Barry (1795 - 1865) who was a surgeon in the army and, upon his demise, it was discovered that he was actually a she. Barry worked for the army in South Africa and was, to all intents and purposes, a child prodigy, having gained her diploma at 13. Her work and surgical skills even earned the praise of Admiral Nelson. Barry's career took her to Malta and Corfu where she died and her secret was revealed. Basically...<br /><br />"... it stands as an indisputable fact, that a woman was for 40 years an officer in the British service, and fought one duel and had sought many more, had pursued a legitimate medical education, and received a regular diploma, and had acquired almost a celebrity for skill as a surgical operator."<br />    - The Manchester Guardian, 21 August, 1865.</i></blockquote><br />How cool is that? This also caught my eye:<br /><blockquote><i>Charles Blondin (né Jean François Gravelet) (1824 - 1897) was one of the original stunt men. He was one of the first men to walk a tightrope over Niagara Falls while either pushing a wheelbarrow, carrying a passenger, making an omelette or blindfolded. He died a natural death.</i></blockquote><br />Ah, but could he do the omelette blindfold?

And it leads me to pose this question. Is it worse to have written a lot of awful, cheesy dialogue, which probably doesn't fit into the overall pattern of your work of fiction, or not to have written anything?<br /><br />It's OK. I know the answer to that. However I am tempted to see what words of wisdom Microsoft Word Help has to offer...<br /><br />Aaah! It has things to tell me! They are: "About preventing loss of work" and "Recover files." It's telling me to keep plugging away at this and not to delete anything. My path is clear...<br /><br />This is getting really freaky now.

Just got asked a spontaneous question on <a href="http://www.twenty-questions.com/about/" target="_blank">Twenty Questions</a> - which doesn't happen nearly as often as you wish it would. I'm pleased with this question, and so include it here. But I do wonder what the young are reading these days... <br /><br /><blockquote><i>"You answered ambrosianna`s question What is the meaning of life? your answer Oh dear, I seem to be the first sad person to have given the answer 42 . Can you explain what 42 means?"</i></blockquote><br /><br />(Spelling and punctuation in the above are original. Anyone who doesn't know the answer, or who wants to see how it was answered, or who wants to ask me a spontaneous question themselves, should just go ahead and <a href="http://astrofiammante.twenty-questions.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>. Scroll to the bottom for the question-asking link.) <br /><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />In EdMo news, my former lovers are very nearly at the end of their argument.

It wasn't an ideal job for several reasons that contravene the not-talking-about-clients-on-one's-publi<wbr />cly-available-blog rule, but it means that some advertising, somewhere, is working. And also I've had someone get in touch via a listing of mine in a web-based freelancers' directory. This is unusual, positive, and encouraging. New clients are on the horizon. I feel good about this.

This is just superb. In Microsoft Word, there is a box at the top which says: "Type a question for help."<br /><br />So I asked: "How do I resolve this messy and painful argument my characters are having about their past?"<br /><br />And, do you know what? It has advice for me. It says: "Adjust character spacing."<br /><br />Presumably that means letting them get close enough for someone to say "Shut up and kiss me, dammit." <br /><br />What do you think? It'll mess up the plot a bit, since they're not actually scheduled to do that for quite a while, and the plot depends on a degree of antipathy between them that'll be ruined if they stroll off hand-in-hand into the sunset now.<br /><br />But, my point is, it has constructive advice for me! Perhaps I will have to include a thank-you to Bill Gates...

That rarest of sporting moments, when the odds go in your favour for once, and things work out as you hope they will but also better than you could possibly have expected. <br /><br />The only thing better than this would be Tottenham beating Arsenal at Highbury (or Ipswich beating Norwich at Carrow Road, if you happen to be my Beloved Other Half).<br /><br />Proof that I didn't fall asleep and dream the whole thing:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4318685.stm" target="_blank"> Coulthard thrills Red Bull boss</a></b><br /><br />David Coulthard won the praise of Red Bull team boss Christian Horner after finishing fourth in Australia.<br /><br />Horner said Coulthard had driven an "unbelievable" race on his debut for the team that was formerly Jaguar.<br /><br />"To be fourth on merit is a fantastic result," said Horner, who saw his other driver Christian Klien finish seventh.<br /><br />Coulthard said: "We wouldn't have been up here if it wasn't for the unsual conditions of qualifying but I have to be happy with fourth."<br /><br />Coulthard staged a race-long battle with Williams driver Mark Webber and was second for a large part of the afternoon, but lost places to Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello and Renault's Fernando Alonso at the second pit stops.<br /><br />"I lost a lot of time in traffic - I hit a Minardi and seemed to pass about six Jordans out there," the Scot said.<br /><br />"All it would have taken was track position and I could have held off Alonso."</i></blockquote><br />- - - - -<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4322933.stm" target="_blank"> McLaren boss criticises drivers</a></b><br /><br />McLaren boss Ron Dennis criticised both his drivers after they squandered the chance of a strong result at the Australian Grand Prix.<br /><br />Juan Pablo Montoya lost a podium place when he ran off the track and finished sixth, while Kimi Raikkonen was eighth after several errors.<br /><br />"It was character building. We had the pace to win, but that is not the way to go motor racing," Dennis said. "The only team in front of us whose pace has concerned us are Renault."<br /><br />Montoya qualified ninth and was battling for a podium place when he made a mistake late in the race which allowed Rubens Barrichello and Fernando Alonso to leapfrog him.<br /><br />That lost the Colombian the opportunity to pass David Coulthard and Mark Webber.<br /><br />"Juan Pablo threw away second place," Dennis said. "He went off and got dirt on the tyres. When you do that they cool down very quickly and lose grip."<br /><br />Raikkonen was the faster of the two McLaren drivers throughout the weekend, but he consistently made errors when it mattered.<br /><br />He lost a grid position to Montoya in final qualifying on Sunday morning and was then forced to start from the pit lane after stalling on the grid.<br /><br />Having climbed to 10th place, Raikkonen ran wide and damaged an aerodynamic aid on his car, which slowed him for the rest of the race.<br /><br />"Kimi's race was effectively over after he stalled the car at the start," Dennis said. "During the race he was hampered by the loss of a deflector which subsequently jammed underneath the car."</i></blockquote><br />(Stories from <a href="ttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/default.stm" target="_blank">BBC Online Motorsport</a>.)<br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />My recollection is that DC's last podium finish was after winning in Monaco in 2002. Things have been pretty grim for his fans since then. <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=_random_'><img src='http://piktures.deadjournal.com/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/users/_random_/'><b>_random_</b></a></span> and I were watching this race in two separate places, and spent nearly the whole time on the phone to each other saying: "Don't get your hopes up, it can't last, he can't possibly hold second place."<br /><br />Well, we were right about that. But, as Random says, if you'd told us before the race, and especially after first qualifying when Klien had the better time, that DC would be fourth with both McLaren drivers behind him, we'd have been pretty pleased. Also, the post-race interview was revealing - he was a completely different man from the one who had to spend the whole of last season justifying McLaren's inadequacies.<br /><br />I'm old and wise enough to know that this isn't going to last, which is why I'm going on about it at such length now. I want to preserve the moment.<br /><br />But I still think knocking bits off Minardis as you go past them is a bit unkind, even if they have accepted cash from a neo-nazi...<br /><br />- - - - - -<br /><br />Drivers' points: <br /><br />David Coulthard 	Red Bull 	GB 	5<br />Juan Pablo Montoya 	McLaren 	Col 	3<br />Christian Klien 	Red Bull 	Aut 	2<br />Kimi Raikkonen 	        McLaren         Fin 	1<br /><br />Constructors' points:<br /><br />Red Bull 	7<br />McLaren 	4<br /><br />So, Ron Dennis, does Juan Pablo Montoya still look like a better choice of driver than DC right now? I think not...

Not updating much, due to EdMo, which is occupying my every waking moment. But here's a nice little news story from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4320773.stm" target="_blank">BBC Online</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b> US town to party with the dead</b><br /><br />Bredo Morstoel is the life and soul of his Colorado town's unusual annual festival - despite being dead for 15 years.<br /><br />Known as Grandpa, the 89-year-old Norwegian's body was discovered cryogenically frozen in a shed in 1994.<br /><br />But the people of Nederland, a small mining town 35 miles (56km) north-west of Denver, decided to turn the discovery to their advantage.<br /><br />In 2002, the first Frozen Dead Guy Days festival was held in a bid to attract tourists and preparations for this year's event are under way.<br /><br />T-shirts and baseball caps are already on sale and garish publicity posters - one bearing the phrase 'It Came From Cryogenics" - produced.<br /><br />Events include a "Thaw Your Bones" chilli cook-off, live music, coffin races, a Champagne tour of Grandpa's shed, a Grandpa pub crawl and even a Grandpa look-a-like competition.<br /><br />Among the invited guests for next week's event are President George W Bush and King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway, urged by the town's Chamber of Commerce to take part in the "fun and parody of the weekend".<br /><br />But they are also being asked to help Grandpa Bredo's daughter - Aud Morstoel - get a visa so she can act as the event's parade marshal.<br /><br />Her application may be refused as she was forced to leave the US for violating her visa by staying four months longer than it allowed after the discovery of her father's body.<br /><br />Aud Morstoel's son Trygve Bauge, who is lobbying politicians, embassies and the media to secure his mother's visa, said: "They are trying to deny it.<br /><br />"They are dragging their feet. They should have given us this a long time ago."<br /><br />Mr Bauge cryogenically prepared his gradfather's body, which is encased in an aluminium casket and covered in dry ice in a shed. It is hoped the body will one day be revived or cloned.<br /><br />Grandpa Bredo was discovered when Mr Bauge was deported for immigration violations and Aud Morstoel was left behind with the body.<br /><br />A caretaker replenishes the ice around his body when it is necessary.<br /><br />During the event, Grandpa will stay at home while the festivities go on around him - but organisers say his spirit will help ensure a party to remember.</i></blockquote>

Here is where editing gets you. EdMo has been going on for less than 24 hours and I am losing my sanity. I have spent some of that time in a cemetery in north-west London, and some of it in Cambridge (yes, Cambridge, what of it?) and an awful lot on trains, all in the service of my bloody WriMo story.<br /><br />I have spent the whole of today listening to imaginary (and often staggeringly banal) conversations being conducted between people who only exist in my head. It is exhausting.<br /><br />As a result, two of my characters are now locked into an appalling subplot which requires them to do the emotional equivalent of slicing each other to bits with samurai swords.<br /><br />I would honestly prefer a physical fight. I have murdered at least four characters in my writing career. I have created psychopaths; had people tortured; forced them to endure two decades of unrequited love; given them such severe personality disorders that they think exchanging nods with the people tending the next grave along from the one they have adopted as their own pet project is normal and fulfilling social intercourse.<br /><br />That's OK. I can handle all that. I'm not ashamed. In fact, I'm quite cool about it.<br /><br />But ask two adults to have a conversation about how they are feeling, especially if one of them isn't behaving very well about it, and I'm out of the door and running down the road screaming "It wasn't me... Make the nasty thing go away..." And the worst, the very worst part about it? I suspect the resulting dialogue is excruciating. There, I said it.<br /><br />I've said it before, and it bears repeating. God help us all if they ever try to have sex with each other. At the moment, I'll retrain as an accountant before I tackle that one.

From <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4306595.stm" target="_blank">BBC Online</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>How MI5 watched children's author</b><br /><br />One of the UK's best known children's authors was watched by MI5 in the 1920s and 30s because it feared he was a traitor working for Moscow.<br /><br />Arthur Ransome, author of Swallows and Amazons in 1930, married Trotsky's secretary and travelled widely in the Soviet Union for British newspapers.<br /><br />He kept London informed of what he learnt and intelligence chiefs passed details to the King.<br /><br />But it took MI5 20 years to finally concede Ransome was loyal to Britain.<br /><br />For most people, Leeds-born Ransome will be remembered for his story of idyllic childhood holidays in the Lake District, where the most exciting thing that happens is boating on slightly choppy waters.*<br /><br />But years before its publication, Ransome, whose name first appeared in MI5 files in 1918, was an active socialist and foreign correspondent who reported on the Russian Revolution.<br /><br />His links to the Bolshevik leadership were cemented when he fell in love with Trotsky's secretary, Evgenia Shelepin, whom he would later marry as his second wife. In 1919 he even arrived in Estonia carrying a personal message for its people from Lenin himself.<br />	<br />He had been occasionally briefing British officials on what was going on, but largely regarded himself as a historian of a great moment in history, the files reveal.<br /><br />According to documents released at the National Archives, the British secret services began watching Ransome, given codename S.76, after concerns he had turned his back on Britain.<br /><br />The British consul in Moscow, Robert Bruce Lockhart, had been caught up in a clever Soviet sting operation designed to implicate diplomats in an attempted overthrow of the young regime.<br /><br />So when Ransome hastily left Moscow, London feared the journalist was "indifferent" to the fate of his fellow British citizens and had failed to use his influence in the corridors of power.<br /><br />British officials in Stockholm invited Ransome in for a chat - and their initial conclusion was not favourable. Here was an "exceedingly clever and interesting fellow - but an out and out Bolshevist".<br /><br />Ironically, it was Lockhart himself who eventually spoke out for Ransome, saying he had been a valuable intelligence asset amid the worst chaos of the revolution.<br /><br />"He is quite loyal and willing to help," says one report, referring to Lockhart's observations.<br /><br />"The appearance of working against us is due to his friendship with the Bolshevik leaders, not by any means to any sympathy with the regime, which the Terror has made him detest.<br /><br />"We expect to get a lot of most valuable stuff from him, and it is hoped that you will see your way, so to speak, to leave him along for a bit and give him a chance."<br /><br />Ransome's return to the UK was talked about at high levels in MI5 with London chiefs who decided he should at the very least be searched and escorted for interview at Scotland Yard.<br /><br />The discussions were copied to both the war cabinet and the King.<br /><br />He was indeed interviewed on his return - detectives found him to be clean - and he later returned to Russia for the Manchester Guardian. He wrote a pamphlet defending the principles of the revolution, but reportedly agreed with officials he would not promote "Bolshevik propaganda".<br /><br />And as the chaos worsened in Russia and purges took hold among the Bolshevik leaders, Ransome was given official assistance to bring Miss Shelepin to England, again on the recommendation of Lockhart.<br /><br />Although Ransome was no longer being actively watched, it was not until 1937 - seven years after the publication of Swallows and Amazons - that Ransome's name finally made it off MI5's watch list. <br /></i></blockquote><br /><br />* This statement is complete nonsense, as any reader of the books will recognise, and I can't just leave it sitting there, like a toad under a stone, unremarked. So there.<br /><br />And this, related, story is a hoot: <b><i> Spy's guide to surviving London life</i></b> - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4306523.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4306523.s<wbr />tm</a><br /><br />Thanks to <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=_random_'><img src='http://piktures.deadjournal.com/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/users/_random_/'><b>_random_</b></a></span> for the links.

It's shit, to be frank, and worse than that in FireFox, never mind the dodgy Flash movie that precedes it. It needs an urgent wash-and-brush-up, and a conversion to proper CSS.

For an explanation of why I am an idiot, you need <a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/community/bookcrossing/17139.html" target="_blank">the original rant</a> and <a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/users/astrofiammante/201917.html" target="_blank">the subsequent fatalistic shrug</a>. No wonder Borders were flogging it at half price.<br /><br />Basically, what I am saying here is, that <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099451956/qid=1109619216/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-7059643-7930819" target="_blank">The Rule of Four</a></i> isn't looking very good. I mourn for the heady days when thriller writers used to feel the need to grab the reader by the throat by page one, have the love interest in shot by page three, then to keep a firm grip round the windpipe until the last page was turned. Instead, this author apparently chose instead a long introductory meander through the tiny lives of a set of remarkably unattractive Ivy League-ish college boys who are so self-regarding as to be intolerable. <br /><br />The narrator has a girlfriend who (it so far appears) is so transparently there to demonstrate that there's nothing unnatural about his close personal friendship with his room-mate that I am wondering whether I can actually rouse myself from my ennui long enough to turn another page. At least it would liven up the bloody book a bit if they were shagging. Someone else (an ex-girlfriend I think, see, the boy's <i>definitely not</i> a poof) is described as having 'breasts like eggplants'. I am losing the will to live now. Anyone that can compare breasts to aubergines has <i>never</i> seen a real set. Did Dan Brown ever feel the need to compare breasts to aubergines? Robert Harris? The answer is *no*.<br /><br />The author would do well to remember the liberating effect of the Internet on the writers and readers of thousands of slash fic epics. Their characters are not their own now and there is even less excuse for this kind of nonsense than there used to be. You can have as many one-dimensional girlfriends and aubergine-shaped pairs of tits as you like. If anyone out there cares enough to sniff out even a hint of a homo-erotic subtext, they will be off after it like a greyhound on the scent of a rabbit at the Walthamstow dog track. <br /><br />Of course, I might heave myself upright and summon the will to read a bit more of this nonsense, and find it is really the best thing since sliced bread. Or that they *are* shagging. Or something. Trouble is, do I care? I've said it before: life's just too short for bad thrillers. And on my present form I will be saying it again before long.<br /><br />Someone on Amazon said (and this is an actual quote): "<i>This book kept me turning the pages until the early hours. Everything about it is superb. It has been likened to the Da Vinci code, but such comparisons don't do this novel justice.</i>"<br /><br />I can't possibly be reading the same book. Viral marketing, anyone?<br /><br />(In parenthesis: Quite soon I should think, some commercial publisher is going to notice this slash fic phenomenon and realise there is a willing audience of thousands out there. But how they're going to make money from that realisation is another matter altogether.)<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />Peace and love, not ranting.

Shermie-our-virtual-friend is an artist who manages to do something pretty rare for BlogWorld, which is to use the medium in a completely fresh and original way (images, mostly, you see). But recently she's been toying with words and the results are very good.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />Rant mode's on again. But, hey, it's my journal. Things are a bit tedious on <a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/" target="_blank">Nation States</a> just now, and I feel the need to vent. So you can either bear with me or otherwise just skip this section altogether. <br /><br />It all revolves around a battle for the soul of Scandinavia. There are broadly two camps in this region - the Viking Warlords and authoritarians; and the Scandinavian Social Democrats. The former like to look forward to the imminent coming of Ragnarok and/or anticipate their own residence in Valhalla. They also bang on endlessly about the size of their armies and try to demand that everyone else, ie social democrats like me, should play the game in the way that they do.<br /><br />My (by now rather large) nation <a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/target=display_nation/nation=konigreich_der_nacht" target="_blank">The Constitutional Monarchy of Konigreich der Nacht</a> is a Scandinavian Liberal Paradise that keeps its environment pristine, carefully nurtures its civil and political rights ratings and disregards its economy and military quite shockingly. It is a long way from being alone in this and the VW&As do not like those of us who will not live by their values. They do not believe, almost by definition, in the essential truth contained in this description of the game written by its author Max Barry:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Build a nation and run it according to your own warped political ideals. Create a Utopian paradise for society's less fortunate or a totalitarian corporate police state. Care for your people or deliberately oppress them. Join the United Nations or remain a rogue state. It's really up to you."</i></blockquote> <br /><br />Yes, it is up to me, and I will continue to run my nation as I want in the face of unprovoked attacks from the VW&As every time I show my face on the regional bulletin boards. It is not for nothing that I was the author of a UN resolution which has successfully banned whaling in the NS game world for more than 180 days now - in fact I think that might have been the start of this whole feud. They believe anyone who does not dedicate their lives to the cultivation of a powerhouse economy has no right to speak. I have been branded a third-world nation, oh yes. And they are (I believe) using bogus statistics compiled by players which have no official status to try to enforce their own agendas.<br /><br />But I can deal. I'm getting much better at provoking other players to rise to things while not rising myself - a skill I didn't know it was in my power to demonstrate. (But that, of course, is why you're getting this earful, and not them.) Recently I resorted to calling in The National Yodelling Choir of Konigreich der Nacht to perform a medley from The Sound of Music (the bulletin board equivalent of sticking fingers in ears and going 'La  la la...') <br /><br />I like to think, you see, of Konigreich der Nacht as a little Switzerland located in Scandinavia. Soon it is going to have its own national website, where you can check out the tourist attractions such as the 144th annual Wine Festival and the Cheese Fair, find out about Konigreich der Nacht as a wedding destination and learn about our 2014 Winter Olympic Bid ("Konigreich der Nacht: Candidate State"). We're in hot negotiations to get our own Grand Prix. When it's live, you'll be the first to know. Together, we shall overcome.

Here's a story from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4296035.stm" target="_blank">BBC News Online</a> about the state of The Pope's health:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Doctors 'consider' Pope surgery</b><br /><br />Pope John Paul II has been admitted to hospital for the second time this month for flu-related breathing problems. <br /><br />According to Italian media reports, doctors are considering performing an operation on which could help him breathe more easily. <br /><br />The Vatican says he has suffered a relapse of his flu condition. <br /><br />The 84-year-old Pope spent 10 days in the Gemelli Hospital earlier this month suffering throat spasms brought on by the flu. He went home on 10 February. <br /><br />Reports say doctors at the Gemelli in Rome are considering a tracheotomy, where a small opening is cut into the neck and the windpipe so air can directly flow into the lungs.</i></blockquote><br />Now, all this sounds rather serious and it will be no surprise if we are looking at a Convocation pretty soon. <br /><br />I don't wish to offend anyone's religious sensibilities, to trivialise the Pope's ill health, or to wish the man into his grave, regardless of his views on abortion. As it happens, I am told he was responsible for christening my landlord while he was Bishop of Krakow (Karol Wojtyla, that is, not my landlord) and not everyone can claim to have been christened by a Pope. <br /><br />But I will just say that anyone who hasn't read Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon thriller, <a href="http://www.danbrown.com/novels/angels_demons/plot.html" target="_blank">Angels and Demons</a>, should know that takes place during a Convocation. And reading it during a Convocation should immeasurably enhance it.<br /><br />Now Karol Wojtyla has been an extraordinary Pope in a number of ways, including his longevity. As it happens, he's taken over from the Queen Mother as journalistic shorthand for The Next Big Story For Which All Leave Is Cancelled. But the last Convocation was in 1978, and you might regret it if you have to wait as long again before gaining a whole new dimension for the reading of this excellent book. That's all I'm saying.

I'm on the horns of a dilemma regarding the <b><a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/users/astrofiammante/197084.html">Time Out Short Story Competition</a></b>. It has come to me that I already have three perfectly good short stories written that would be suitable for this. <br /><br />Which is helpful, since I seem to have just committed myself to spending March writing <a href="http://www.nanoedmo.org/" target="_blank">another 50,000 words of <i>The Conspiracy Theorist</i></a>. And the short story project I have in mind at the moment is aimed at another competition altogether - due to be held at next year's <a href="http://www.restormel.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=8620/" target="_blank">Daphne Du Maurier Festival</a> (2006, that is - nothing like planning ahead). <br /><br />That requires a story in the style of the author. I have a marvellous wild and windswept Cornish setting, and something of an idea for the opening scene, but no sense of what actually happens yet. It needs to be thought about. The Daffers competition is held every two years - this year they will announce last year's winner and, hopefully, the theme for the next one, so it's important to be prepared if you're a big fan, as I am.<br /><br />So I could really do with just being able to pull something out of the hat for <i>Time Out</i> and it seems I am blessed with riches. There is, for example, the story about the well-heeled bargain-hunter poking about in Leather Lane market. It's about London (although, as far as I know, that isn't specified) and I like it because I'm fond of that part of town. But it has never really grabbed <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=_random_'><img src='http://piktures.deadjournal.com/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/users/_random_/'><b>_random_</b></a></span>, and I'm not actually sure how good it really is.<br /><br />Then there's the tale of the advertising rep who skips an unwanted meal with a potential client thanks to chaos on the West London Tube lines. I wasn't even considering this until I read it back, and found it was better than I had thought, again with a nice strong London theme and a twist in the tail.<br /><br />But I know in my heart that by far the best of the three is the first-person piece from the woman whose hobby is visiting a cemetery. This has provoked spontaneous compliments from clients in the past who found it tucked away in a remote corner of my professional website. I happen to know that it is set in Chiswick Old Cemetery, but there is no way for the casual observer to recognise that. So, how important do I think the London theme is? And, knowing that it is probably easier to win the lottery than a short story competition like this, to what extent am I going to see the point of being hard-headed? Why not be fatalistic instead, and just submit my favourite?<br /><br />And then I went and checked the deadline, which I thought might be at the end of March, and discovered it wasn't until the end of April. Which means that I should really quit with this nonsense, already, and think about doing some work instead. <br /><br />Thanks for listening. The point of typing all this out is, of course, to clarify my own thoughts. And I think I have. I think it's the cemetery one. Oh well. Here goes.

This jumped out at me, from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" target="_blank">The Guardian's</a> political email <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/backbencher/" target="_blank">The Backbencher</a>. <br /><br />It is billed as follows: "Richard Norton-Taylor, the Guardian's security affairs editor, on new revelations about the attorney general's advice [on the legality of the Iraq war]."<br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Revelations today - partly based on a book by international lawyer Philippe Sands - provide much more detailed information about how the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, drew up what he calls the legal justification for the war in Iraq. Indeed, it emerges that Lord Goldsmith did not write what the government presented as the final official legal opinion backing war.<br /><br />"That advice was drawn up, we now know, by Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan, one of the political figures in the Cabinet Office. This was in answer to a planted parliamentary question, put in the Lords, to which Lord Goldsmith put his name. And it came on the eve of a crucial Commons vote on the war.<br /><br />"At the time, the government presented this as the attorney general's official opinion but it was not written by him - although he does say he agrees with it. All this comes against the backdrop of the government's persistent refusal to reveal the attorney general's official advice on the legality of the war. It appears Lord Goldsmith changed his mind a few times, and we still don't know enough of what he said.<br /><br />"We know that on March 7 - two weeks before the war - the attorney general warned an invasion could be found to be illegal in an international court of law. After that, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, the chief of the defence staff, said he wanted something unequivocal. Lord Boyce finally got a short note from the attorney general's office to that effect.<br /><br />"That wasn't his own personal advice, it now seems: he was lent [sic] on. But Lord Goldsmith also asked Tony Blair whether Iraq was still in breach of its UN disarmament obligations. Mr Blair said of course it was, but the PM based that judgment on intelligence which we now know was faulty. So this raises very serious questions about the legality of the war and about the position of the attorney general.<br /><br />"The government keeps saying that we journalists are only interested in the process and not the substance. This is quite a dangerous response, because due process demands that the attorney general should actually have given proper, independent legal advice. What was presented to MPs on the eve of the war as the attorney general's opinion was not drawn up by him at all but by Mr Blair's political colleagues.<br /><br />"Although the government wants to move on from Iraq to concentrate on domestic issues, the dispute about what legal advice was given - and the refusal to release it - goes to the heart of the issue of trust in the government."</i></blockquote>

Well, interested parties had better consider me unavailable for March. I went and had a peek at the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a> website last night out of curiosity after recommending someone else take a look.<br /><br />And I found this:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>About NaNoEdMo</b><br /><br />So you've finished the first draft of your novel.

Inspired — perhaps coerced — by National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), NaNoEdMo gives novelists the support and inspiration they need to take their novel to the next level.<br /><br />The mission, should you choose to accept it: to complete 50 hours worth of solid editing, revising or re-writing — roughly enough time for one bonzai edit of a 50,000 word novel — all in a mind-boggling 31 days.<br /><br />[snip]<br /><br />Insane? Perhaps. Doable? Definitely. Especially when you’ve got a bunch of other crazy folks doing the same thing right alongside you.<br /><br />Clock your 50 hours by midnight March 31 and you’re a winner. You may not have reached the end of your editing tasks, but you will have made a solid start.</i></blockquote><br /><br />Oh, God. What do they think I spent December, January and February doing? I'm already locked into a hopeless spiral of editing. What I really want to do is to write the second half. <br /><br />So, I didn't really think <a href="http://www.nanoedmo.org" target="_blank">NaNoEdMo</a> was going to be for me, at least until I saw this bit in the FAQs:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>My novel isn't completely finished. Can I go ahead and do NaNoEdMo, even if some of the 50 hours may be spent writing, not just rewriting?<br /><br />Yep.</i></blockquote><br />So I might try for another 50,000 words, or 50 hours' work on <i>The Conspiracy Theorist</i> during the month of March. Especially since the site developers are promising another cool little blue progress bar - that was a real motivator for me.<br /><br />If anyone else intends to try this and is looking for <a href="http://www.nanoedmo.org/faqs.html" target="_blank">buddies</a>, do let me know.

Whaling news from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4282627.stm" target="_blank">BBC Online</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>'No surge' in minke whale numbers</b><br /><br />Genetic research on Tokyo whale meat reveals that minke whales may not be experiencing an unprecedented surge in numbers as had previously been thought.<br /><br />It was said the species' success had hampered the recovery of other whales, and that hunting of minkes would be sustainable and beneficial.<br /><br />But the tests indicate no such number boom - only a steady population growth over a period of a million years.<br /><br />The results were outlined at a major science conference in Washington DC. Steve Palumbi, of Stanford University in California, examined whale meat in Japanese shops.<br /><br />The meat, sold legally, comes from carcasses of whales taken for scientific research under the rules set down by the International Whaling Commission.<br /><br />The American scientist looked at the variations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).<br /><br />This DNA is found in the cell's "powerhouses" and is passed down through the generations on the maternal side only.<br /><br />Because researchers know how quickly mtDNA accumulates errors, they can assign rough timescales to the population changes they see.<br /><br />The Stanford researcher used DNA sequences from 179 individuals to build a family tree that led back to a "minke Eve" alive around one million years ago.<br /><br />"The size and depth of that gene tree tells you a lot about past population size, and the shape of that gene tree tells you a lot about past population size changes," he told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).<br /><br />"The results show that Antarctic minke whales have the greatest genetic diversity of any whale population we have ever sampled."<br /><br />The information could prove critical to current discussions of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).<br /><br />The Institute of Cetacean Research in Japan has proposed that minke whales used to be rare and have only become abundant in recent times. They estimate that numbers have increased from around 100,000 to approximately 800,000 just in the last hundred years.<br /><br />This, they claim, is hindering the recovery of other Antarctic whale species - pointing to the need for resumed whaling.<br /><br />But the genetic results tell a different story, showing a rapid population expansion and steady growth with no appreciable booms and busts.<br /><br />"There is really no evidence at all that minke whales right now are so abundant that they are hindering the recovery of great whales in Antarctica," said Dr Palumbi.<br /><br />"Minkes were not rare before the age of Antarctic whaling and their present population size is not a reflection of a recent, huge increase. They are not weeds that need to be pulled."<br /><br />The findings also reveal that minke whales are extraordinarily resilient to climate change.<br /><br />Their population sizes have not been noticeably affected by large climatic fluctuations over the past million years; though researchers are at a loss to explain why. </i></blockquote><br />Using <a href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/email/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4282627.stm" target="_blank">this link</a>, I have emailed this story to the following addresses:<br /><ul><br /><li>The Icelandic ambassador to the UK - sverrir.h.gunnlaugsson@utn.stjr.is<br /><li>The Icelandic Tourist Board - info@icetourist.is<br /><li>The Icelandic Embassy - iemb.london@utn.stjr.is <br /><li>The Icelandic Chamber of Commerce – info@chamber.is<br /></ul><br />And I have included the following message:<br /><br /><i>"Yet another reason why I am no longer prepared to visit Iceland while it continues whaling."</i><br /><br />Anyone who feels strongly about this issue might consider doing the same...</li></li></li></li>

I have been Forced to Go Out. After some days of alternate hibernation and frantic feature-writing, to the sound of deadlines rushing by like cars on the motorway. To Do Errands. Cheques must be paid into the bank, parcels posted and stationery bought. Luckily for me, the most congenial venue for achieving all this is our nearest Big Shopping Metropolis, which means venturing onto Public Transport, since <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=_random_'><img src='http://piktures.deadjournal.com/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.deadjournal.com/users/_random_/'><b>_random_</b></a></span> has appropriated my car for work, bless his little cotton socks.<br /><br />The direct and sensible route is across the local park. Kicking the muggers, rapists and disadvantaged local youngsters (not even required to pretend to turn up for education this week since it is half term) to left and right. In the manner of one Buffy Summers on a busy night in the Sunnydale graveyard. On reaching the bus stop on the other side, one can then enjoy the delights of breathing exhaust fumes for 45 minutes on a spectacularly cramped bus filled with pensioners on their way to the local supermarket. They will generously share with you their view that no-one under the age of 50 has a right to a seat, even if the whole back half of the bus is empty. If you do get to sit down, don’t expect the privilege to last. On one wonderful occasion some years ago, a driver took a corner a bit sharply and launched one of the aforementioned old ladies, plus her shopping bags, straight into the aisle <i>sur son derri&egrave;re</i>.<br /><br />No. This bus route, which used to operate with comfortable double-deckers when I was at school, is not for me. Little point then in going into the nearest town instead and just picking it up even earlier. I am going to take a different bus service which goes in the opposite direction and allows me to maintain the illusion that I don't live in the nearest town at all, but am in fact a resident of the affluent neighbourhood over the border in the next borough. Having travelled a certain distance, I am going to get on a train and travel in style to the Big Shopping Metropolis.<br /><br />For some reason that I don't understand, but don't want to inquire into too closely in case it goes away, trains and Tubes bring out in me a powerful urge to write. During November I was working pretty intensively in central London and was spending more than two hours each day travelling in and out. This was extremely useful because, as regular readers will doubtless recall, November was NaNoWriMo month. Every day my story would advance by a couple of chapters or more. <br /><br />During work downtime I would type up my new stuff and then plan what was going to happen next with the help a USB drive. More writing on the Tube going home, even using the laptop for frantic underground typing on occasions. But more usually scribbling rapidly in a spiral-bound reporter's notebook with a pink or purple Uniball Vision Elite (very smooth action, recommended for creative writing but a bit thick in the nib for shorthand) in my outlandishly scribbly and untidy handwriting – I never learned to write joined-up. I wondered a bit what people were thinking, especially if people were attempting the physically extremely exacting feat of reading what I was writing. They would have had a shock – the story is a thriller and replete with people being stalked, followed, harassed and even horribly murdered. But mostly I was busy.<br /><br />On getting home in the evening, it was usual for Random to be at work so I’d make a few passes in the direction of food, a much more determined effort at procuring myself a large Scotch, boot up the laptop and type up all the latest stuff from the journey home. In this way I managed to achieve a wordcount of 35,046 words before the barrier fell at midnight on November 30 (a bit short of the 50k target, admittedly, but not too bad given I hadn’t actually started writing until November 7.) Over the next couple of months I got it up to 50,000; let Random read it; made a lot of edits, additions and corrections based on that, and tidied up until it was a little over 55k. Now it has gone out into the wide world for the opinions of a couple of other people, which is a scary if necessary thing.<br /><br />And it's time for me to crack on and solve several problems that we've recently spotted with the existing draft – largely designed to introduce a couple of standard thriller elements that I had so far neglected to include. And also to pick up the second half of the story. Pretty soon I am going to have to get on a train and go to Cambridge, all in the name of research of course. And if anyone out there has ever attended an Evangelical/charismatic church service in Britain, I could do with <a href="mailto:astrof@astrofiammante.net" target="_blank">talking to you</a>. But the short train journey I made the other day had a great effect. Out came the notepad and the funny-coloured pen. Problems were solved, characters gained background, a big new plot element was sorted out.<br /><br />So if you’re travelling on a train any time soon, and you see someone writing away for all they are worth, then staring into thin air with a furrowed brow, then scribbling frantically in pink ink again, it is possible that you will have met me. Don’t worry – I am usually relatively harmless, despite any appearance to the contrary, and safe to approach. But I might tell you to shut up if I’ve just come up with a really good bit.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />For anyone left wondering about the trip to the Big Shopping Metropolis, I will just mention that it was very civilised, everything that needed to be done was done, and it only resulted in one book purchase (and only one pen - a turquoise Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V5 extra-fine). I came slowly to a halt outside Borders where there was a big display of <i>The Rule of Four</i> (Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason) with large and prominent 'HALF PRICE' stickers on them. Well, that was me hooked.<br /><br />On January 8, in my other journal <img src="http://piktures.deadjournal.com/userinfo.gif"><b><a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/users/bookcrossing" target="_blank">That Reading Thing</a></b>, I wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>"I have added a new rule to Astrofiammante's List of Guidelines for Life. It is this: I am never buying another book that claims to be 'The Next Harry Potter' or 'The Next Da Vinci Code' again. I have brought so many turkeys by falling repeatedly for this silly marketing trick that, were it not for Bookcrossing it would perpetually be Boxing Day around here."</i></blockquote><br />Yeah, right. Here are some quotes from the cover of <i>The Rule of Four</i>:<br /><br /><i>"If you loved The Da Vinci Code, dive into this..."</i> - People Magazine<br /><br /><i>"One part The Da Vinci Code, one part The Name of the Rose..."</i> - San Francisco Chronicle<br /><br />It's like a huge chain letter, all traceable back to Dan Brown. You buy a thriller, on the back of the jacket is a comparison with a few other thrillers so you buy them and on the jacket...<br /><br />Will someone come and find me when it's the cup final, or there's a general election, or when something else big happens?

Fun and games this morning. I love it when the forces of corporate reaction reply to protest emails and allow you to waste even more of their time.

"Fortunately everybody has seen the funny side and Angela has said it was an interesting show and that there was no harm done."<br /><br />Ms Innes said the incident was in no way an indication of the Arches' attitude towards the work or the artist.<br /><br />"I thought it was a joke or something, I didn't think it was art - so I threw it in the bin," said Mrs Fowler.<br /><br />This is not the first time an artist has suffered the indignity of having their work mistaken for garbage. A bag of rubbish which formed part of a Gustav Metzger work which was said to demonstrate the "finite existence" of art was thrown away by a cleaner at Tate Britain in London last year while in 2001 a Damien Hirst installation was mistaken for trash by a cleaner at London's Eyestorm Gallery.<br /><br />Yesterday, Gillian McCormack, a spokeswoman for the NRLA's organisers, said the artist had not complained. "The installation was due to be cleaned up the next day anyway so it's not as if a permanent exhibit has been destroyed," she said.</i></blockquote>

There's an excellent interview with Stockard Channing in today's <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk" target="_blank">Independent</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Stockard Channing: One tough cookie</b><br /><br />From Pink Lady to First Lady, Stockard Channing is much like the women she's played - strong, intelligent, blunt. And scary? Clare Rudebeck steels herself...<br /><br />16 February 2005<br /><br />Stockard Channing has a dodgy knee. She's grimacing and moving it hesitantly back and forth. This is not what I expected. Channing has made a career out of playing scary, no-nonsense types - the sort of women who knee men in the balls, not ask them for help crossing the road. But could this twinge in the knee be evidence that the 61-year-old actress may be having to slow down? No. "I was filming an action sequence yesterday and I think I did something to my leg," she says, leaning forward in a plush armchair at the Covent Garden Hotel. She's in London to film Red Mercury, in which she plays a Greek restaurateur who is held hostage by terrorists. "Yes, I got to do some rolls," she says.</i></blockquote><br /><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/story.jsp?story=611405" target="_blank"><br />Read on here...</a>

Ewww. From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">New York Times</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Please Don't Call the Customers Dead</b><br /><br />THE live-in customers at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation here reside in eight 10-foot-high steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen. They are incapable of breathing, thinking, walking, riding a bike or scratching an itch. But don't refer to them as deceased.<br /><br />They may be frozen at minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit and identified by prisonlike numbers. But to Alcor, the 67 bodies - in many cases, just severed heads - are patients who may live again if science can just figure out how to reanimate them.<br /><br />"They're no different than a flat-lining patient who gets a defibrillator to bring them back to life," said Joseph A. Waynick, Alcor's president and chief executive. "With our patients, the only difference is length of time."<br /><br />Alcor is a small nonprofit company built on the spectacular wager that it can rescue its patients from natural post-mortem deterioration until a distant time when cellular regeneration, nanotechnology, cloning or some other science can restart their lives, as if the diseases, heart attacks, old age, murders or accidents that concluded their first go-rounds had never happened.<br /><br />So far, nobody has been revived. And there is little evidence that anybody ever will be. The first intentionally frozen man, James Bedford, is still here - 38 years after his official death and 20 years after he was moved from a storage facility where his family kept him frozen in liquid nitrogen. No one has been thawed out, except for a woman whose sister successfully sued to get the body out of deep freeze.<br /><br />Alcor's most renowned frozen parts - the head and trunk of the once-mighty Ted Williams, the Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer - are in one of the gigantic tanks. He is there despite a protracted family feud that balanced the slugger's will, which stated his desire to be cremated, against a note he signed from a sickbed, which said he preferred to be frozen. The note won.<br /><br />What Alcor sells is hope - if only, so far, to a small sliver of the potentially dead. But like its customers, the company is optimistic: it sees itself primarily as a research facility that looks beyond the old-fashioned post-death options of burial and cremation.<br /><br />Alcor executives are convinced that cryonics will catch on someday, and they have recently stepped up the company's marketing - inviting the public for tours of its facility, for example - to make sure that it happens sooner rather than later.</i></blockquote><br /><br />Want to learn more...? <a href="http://www.alcor.org/">http://www.alcor.org/</a> - check out the photo gallery...

Here's a quote from someone else who doesn't like the prospect of ID cards any more than we do. This chap is a magistrate, which should give his words a bit of weight, and his blog is a jolly good read at any time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thelawwestofealingbroadway.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The Law West of Ealing Broadway</a>: <b>We Don't Need No Stinkin' Badges</b>.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I am highly sceptical of the plan to bring in compulsory ID cards. There are many false passports in circulation at the moment - so much so that the Court of Appeal laid down late last year (in the case of Kolawole) that simple possession of a false passport must attract twelve to eighteen months, even on a person of good character pleading guilty at an early stage. Quite recently we saw a man who had been arrested for a minor shoplifting offence. On being searched he was found to be carrying a false passport that had got him into the country a few days earlier. Off he went to Ealing Broadway Crown Court for sentence. Forgers are well able to deploy high technology, and anything will be available if the price is right.</i></blockquote><br /><a href="http://thelawwestofealingbroadway.blogspot.com/2005/02/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-badges.html" target="_blank">Read on here...</a>

How to waste time this Saturday:<br /><br />Take two gigantic pomegranates, bought at the greengrocer last Saturday, and sorely in need of being used up.<br /><br />Disassemble the pomegranates in such a way that you have all the little red fruity bits in a blender jug with no pith, peel or any of the internal separator stuff; also none of the little red fruity bits that have gone slightly funny, these pomegranates being more than a week old. <br /><br />Clear up the mess.<br /><br />Assemble the blender. Add a little water to facilitate blending, and blend.<br /><br />Strain the resulting gunk to remove all the seeds, bits of pith, peel and internal separator stuff that you missed. This will give you a small amount of pomegranate juice. <br /><br />Disassemble the blender and put the bits to soak in cold water to remove the pomegranaty gunk.<br /><br />Assemble the juicer. Hunt around for the missing bits, and eventually find them. Slice up the three Cox's apples you have been saving for this purpose and juice them.<br /><br />Clear up the mess.<br /><br />Disassemble the juicer and put the bits to soak in cold water to remove the apple pulp.<br /><br />Add the small amount of resulting apple juice to the small amount of pomegranate juice already obtained. Stir vigorously, pour into glasses and summon significant other.<br /><br />Each say 'Cheers!' and drink your small glass of (admittedly very nice) juice.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />This reminds me of an episode of <b>Northern Exposure</b> that I think is in season four and called "The Big Feast" - where Adam the chef reduces an entire ox carcass into one small cup of stock...

Unquote quiz; Jeremy Butterfield, the editor-in-chief of Collins English Dictionaries; and Suzi Feay, Literary Editor of The Independent on Sunday.<br /><br />Would they go for "pollutocrat: one whose affluent lifestyle gives rise to a high level of pollution" (Martin Quick of Stroud)? Or "blissinform: to misinform in the hope of avoiding unnecessary pain" (Helen Moss of Cambridge)? What about "punnegrines: the wrinkles that appear on your fingers and toes if you stay too long in the bath" (Susannah Phillipson of Oxford)? Or "misterogyny: the hatred of men" (Jo Morrison of Slough)? Then there was "corketry: the art of making articles, especially models, from wine corks", which Donald McDonald of Perth submitted complete with illustrations.<br /><br />In the end, the word that emerged as the winner was "geribanger", submitted by Mary Cousins of Usk in Monmouthshire. "A woman who furthers her career by seducing older men of influence and power" was Ms Cousins's definition. All three judges loved "geribanger", with Jeremy Butterfield believing that amid much punning and witticism, this word had the best chance of actually catching on. "Geribanger" thus finds its place in Collins' online Living Dictionary, and Ms Cousins receives the first prize of a Collins dictionary and a Collins thesaurus.<br /><br />The five runners-up were: Jim Trimmer of Kingston-upon-Thames for "gaity: that proportion of the community made up of gay persons"; Vera Lustig of Walton-on-Thames for "saganaut: elderly, middle-class person with predilection for educational travel"; David Poulter of Lowestoft for "mauble: a verb to describe boring, interminable conversation"; Paul Stronge of London N16 for "emailancholia: depressed and miserable state of mind arising from overuse of computer emails"; and Anna Bristow of Wirksworth in Derbyshire for "nibling: a generic term for a niece or a nephew". They will each receive a Collins Gem dictionary, with its 15-page supplement of new words.<br /><br />The Collins Word Exchange, a new website which invites anyone to contribute to the dictionary, can be found at <a href="http://www.collins.co.uk/wordexchange/" target="_blank">http://www.collins.co.uk/wordexchange/</a><br /></i></blockquote>

This is just great, a real connossieur's conspiracy theory,  because of the amount of things it would tie together. It originates in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk" target="_blank">The Independent</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Could George Bush Snr really be Deep Throat?</b><br /><br />He was the world's most famous journalistic source and heralded the end for Richard Nixon. A new report says he is the former president, another that he is near death. Andrew Buncombe and Rupert Cornwell report.</i></blockquote><br />Unfortunately the odds on W's papa are very long - given by the paper as 50/1. But it's a great thought, and here are the arguments:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>George Bush Snr, US Ambassador at the UN</b><br /><br /><b>Who is he?</b> Bush was US ambassador to the UN from 1971 to 1973 and director of the CIA in 1976-77, later serving two terms as vice-president to Ronald Reagan. In 1988, Bush was elected president, serving one term before being beaten in the 1992 election by Bill Clinton. Now 80, Bush still exerts a degree of influence over the politics of his son, George W, the current President.<br /><br /><b>When did speculation begin?</b> The British-born author Adrian Havill claimed this week on a journalism website that Bush Snr was Deep Throat.<br /><br /><b>The case for</b>: Havill says new research points the finger of suspicion at Bush. He says he became suspicious after President George W Bush, who is known to dislike the press, gave an unusual seven hours of interviews to Woodward for one of his recent books. He argues that Bush Snr had reason to dislike Nixon, who had urged him to leave a safe congressional seat for a Treasury position with the promise that he would later become Treasury Secretary.<br /><br />According to Havill, Nixon did not deliver and Bush was given the task of heading the Republican National Committee. He says that although Bush was UN ambassador (i.e in New York) from 1971 to 1973 he returned to Washington at weekends when seven of the eight meetings with Woodward took place. "My examination of White House records at the National Archives show Bush attending many Washington state dinners and weekly cabinet meetings during that period," wrote Havill. "More importantly, he was in Washington nearly every weekend where he owned a house and where his son Neil attended St Alban's prep school."<br /><br /><b>The case against</b>: Woodward has previously said Deep Throat held a sensitive position within the executive branch of government. This would appear to rule out Bush as being the source. There is also the issue of the flag signal, detailed in <i>All The President's Men</i>. When Woodward needed to meet his source he would put a flag on the balcony of his P Street apartment. How would Bush have known about this in New York? It is also extremely doubtful whether Bush would have been in possession of many of the details about the investigation into the Watergate break-in. Similarly, it is unlikely he would have known about efforts to cover up the plot. Havill has also changed his opinion. In his 1993 book Deep Truth he claimed that Deep Throat was a composite of different sources created by Woodward. Woodward claims never to have interviewed the former president.<br /><br /><b>Odds</b>: 50/1</i></blockquote><br />I will just reproduce the details of a second individual known to the British public:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Pat Buchanan, Speechwriter to Richard Nixon</b><br /><br /><b>Who is he?</b> He was a special assistant and speechwriter for Nixon from 1969 to 1973. Later a broadcaster, he ran as a Republican presidential candidate in 1992, 1996 and 2000.<br /><br /><b>When did the speculation begin?</b> He has long been a favourite Deep Throat suspect. John Dean is but one of several Nixon White House insiders to have listed Buchanan as a prime candidate, and he was one of seven "finalists" in the University of Illinois investigation that concluded Fred Fielding was Deep Throat.<br /><br /><b>The case for</b>: Buchanan was in the White House inner circle, and, by April 1973, he was meeting regularly with President Nixon's lawyers. At the time he was living in downtown Washington just a mile from Woodward's apartment, on whose balcony signs for meetings were set. He is known to have been a smoker, and fond of Scotch. Also, his sister Bay worked for Creep, the Committee to Re-elect the President, which financed Watergate and other "dirty tricks". Buchanan is generally regarded as a Nixon loyalist but he is said to have threatened to resign three months before the break-in after a disagreement with the President's rapprochement with China.<br /><br /><b>The case against</b>: He may be a cantankerous old conservative, but, at the Nixon White House, he was very much a team player; the China motive is seen as very thin. He has denied being Deep Throat, saying he gave up smoking before the March 1972 China trip. John Dean has also claimed that Deep Throat is very ill, Buchanan, at the last sighting, seemed in good health.<br /><br /><b>Odds</b>: 6/1</i></blockquote><br /><br />The story in full: (though how long this link will remain live is questionable)<br /><br /><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=609187">http://news.independent.co.uk/world/ame<wbr />ricas/story.jsp?story=609187</a>

Apparently Alastair Campbell has sent, in error, an email to <i>Newsnight</i> that was actually meant for a colleague.<br /><br />In it, he suggests telling them: "Now, fuck off and cover something important, you twats."<br /><br />He later apologised for his error and said: "Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back."<br /><br />I'm afraid that part of me finds this extremely amusing, for all it says about the character of the Labour Party and of Alastair Campbell. And also sinister - given that the last really notable "silly fuss" was very likely Susan Watts' involvement in the Hutton affair. <br /><br />But part of me wants to say: Yes, this is what it's like to be a journalist these days, and these are the circumstances in which we are supposed to be getting all these balanced and factually unimpeachable stories together. <br /><br />And do just bear that in mind before you start mouthing glib cliches about how we are a bunch of worthless tossers who are less trustworthy than estate agents.<br /><br />- - - - - - -<br /><br />First the rant, then the story in full: <br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4247237.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_polit<wbr />ics/4247237.stm</a>

Congratulations to Ellen MacArthur on breaking the round-the-world solo record. I'm a great fan of hers. Here are some quotes from the <a href="http://email02.wanadoo.co.uk/webmail/inbox_read.html?IDMSG=14663" target="_blank">BBC Online</a> story:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>...After achieving the record time, MacArthur said: "I feel exhausted but I'm elated to be here."<br /><br />She added: "It has been an unbelievable journey.<br /><br />"The whole voyage has been very draining, and there's a lot of things going round in my head.<br /><br />"But it's great that I can finally switch my brain off and relax in the company of others, which I've really missed."<br /><br />The 28-year-old added: "I always believed I could break the record, and Francis agreed it was breakable. But I really didn't think I would do it at the first attempt.<br /><br />"The whole south Atlantic was terrible and it has just been one big draining event from there onwards.<br /><br />"When I crossed the line I felt like collapsing on the floor and just falling asleep. I was absolutely over the moon." </i></blockquote><br /><br />But still to me the most interesting part of this story is why, given that she took the decision not to compete in this year's <a href="http://www.vendeeglobe.org/uk/" target="_blank">Vendee Globe</a>, she should schedule such a headline-grabbing event against it. <br /><br />She says in her book that she made the decision because the fundraising for the 2000 event was so exhausting, and that she would next compete in 2008.<br /><br />I wonder whether she underestimated herself - I bet fundraising now is not nearly as arduous for her as it was then. I wonder if she felt she miscalculated by not entering? Or just regretful? We'll probably never know.<br /><br />To sign off on a lighter note, here's a link to the tale of Ellen's adventures at <a href="http://www.norfolk-broads.com/Contacts/links/ellen.htm" target="_blank">our home boatyard</a> in Norfolk.

Yesterday we were forced by the threat of starvation to go and do the shop that we should have done round about the point we came back from Cornwall - two weeks ago. <br /><br />I have gone on at length in this journal before about how much I hate the tyranny of supermarkets - we have no local shops to speak of, and yet there are something like four Tesco stores and a Sainsburys within a short drive of our flat. Plus the 'local' store which they plan to open at the cost of shutting down one of our few remaining accessible post offices. I hate Tesco with a passion, and find every minute spent in their stores a horrible ordeal. And yet sometimes it seems very, very hard not to shop with them.<br /><br />But yesterday we managed it. Admittedly it meant a medium-length drive to the nearest town that is not the horrible town we live in. This town has proper shops - the ones we don't need, such as the butcher and the fishmonger, and the ones we do, such as the baker, the greengrocer and the cheesemonger. It also has a Waitrose and an M&amp;S food store, hurrah.<br /><br />The best thing about this is the relationship you have with the food you bring home. For instance, yellow plums. A great treat, and vaguely seasonal, as much as any fruit is in February. Part of the appeal was that they looked like they had actually had some sort of relationship with a tree rather than being made on a production line. We bought a bag home, put half of them through the juicer and stewed the other half with some home-made vanilla sugar made with vanilla pods bought in St Ives. <br /><br />This is the way it should be, rather than getting a lot of plastic vegetables flown halfway round the world and with no flavour in the first place, which then sit in the fridge for two weeks with few visible signs of decay. Buy the food available, in the quantities you need, and eat it. Why should this be so bloody difficult?

I'm not a great one for posting song lyrics.

But he is getting less irritated, in the face of my relentless devotion, and has even identified A Song He Likes (<i>"He stole from the rich, and the poor, and the not-very-rich, and the very poor, and he stole all hearts away..."</i>) from the above album. So we won't be too scathing.

From this morning's <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk" target="_blank">Independent</a><br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Murder She Rewrote? Author accused of plagiarising Agatha Christie short story</b><br /><br />The editors of the Australian version of The Big Issue were delighted when Jessica Adams, a prominent "chick-lit" author, agreed to contribute a short story to a special new year edition devoted to new fiction.<br /><br />A thrilling tale of murder and the supernatural, entitled "The Circle", was duly supplied by Adams, whose novels, including Single White E-mail, have been bestsellers in Britain. But for some readers of The Big Issue, the magazine for the homeless, her colourful prose rang a familiar bell.<br /><br />A Brisbane playwright, Janelle Evans, went to her collection of Agatha Christie novels and flicked through the pages of "The Idol House of Astarte", a short story published in 1928. She found that the structure, plot, characters and crime scene were uncannily similar to those in Adams' story.<br /><br />The allegations of plagiarism were splashed across the front of The Australian newspaper yesterday under the headline "Murder, She Rewrote", while Evans recounted her revelation in a lengthy inside feature. Excerpts from the two stories were run side by side, pointing to distinct resemblances between the two.<br /><br />Adams, who has sold more than 400,000 books worldwide, including Girls' Night In and Tom, Dick and Debbie Harry, denied the charge of plagiarism. "I'm a great fan of Agatha Christie, but she's not a source of inspiration," she told Evans, adding that her favourite murder writer was Ruth Rendell.</i></blockquote>

Here are some links to some excellent things that are too long to reproduce here in their entirety, but which are so good/interesting/compelling (in the case of the Kilroy one, like watching a road accident happen) that they really would be worth your while to follow. How long they will remain live for, I cannot say, but I will take the risk for once.<br /><br />1. A really scary piece from The Independent about Mr Kilroy-Silk's new political agenda.<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>In a one-man crusade for the truth, Kilroy can get rid of the facts</b><br />By Johann Hari<br /><br />"I am sitting, semi-conscious, listening to Robert Kilroy-Silk. He stands before a braying pack, all desperate to make their point. It is like being a student again. Except this time, he is not hosting a "discussion" about a depressed single mum who is pregnant by her father's boyfriend's cat, and I am not in bed retching. No, I am at the birth of Veritas, the party founded to accommodate Kilroy's self-regard. I am at the press conference that will "change Britain forever".<br /><br />"It is time to "end the corrupt, lying politics that dominate this country", Kilroy says with the faintly angry expression I know so well from adolescent years spent rotting in front of Z-list daytime TV. "I am here to speak the truth. It's quite an innovation in politics, isn't it? The truth. But that's why I am running." The People have demanded that He - and only He - can save us now. "When I go to Northern market-towns, they come up to me - ordinary people - and they say, 'We won't vote. Not unless you stand. Then we'll vote.'" He pauses carefully and adds, "And Muslims come up to me. They say, 'Why do they ban Christmas carols? We want to sing Christmas carols.'" Ah yes - the persecution of the carol-singing Muslims. Yes - only Kilroy will bring us the Truth, I begin to chant slowly."<br /><br /><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=607246" target="_blank">Read on here...</a></i></blockquote><br />2. A glorious Boris column, from The Telegraph:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>How are you supposed to get on your bike?</b>	<br />By Boris Johnson<br /><br />"You know, I have always had a soft spot for Cherie Blair. You may think I am mad, but I have resented the attacks on her, and suspected that it is to do with the jealousy that surrounds a successful, high-earning woman who possesses a mind of her own.<br /><br />"Good on you, Cherie, baby, I say to myself, when I read about her interest in New Age crystals and her showers with Carole Caplin. Don't you take any notice, girl, I say, when people make uncalled-for personal remarks. A lot of people might say that Cherie looks pretty foxy, especially when you consider the strain of being married to Blair. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/02/03/do0302.xml" target="_blank">Read on here...</a></i></blockquote><br />3. I can't do justice to this one in words, you'll just have to go and look at it. From The Guardian's Backbencher column:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; WHO YOU GONNA CALL?</b><br /><br />Calling Charles Clarke. Are you having trouble finding out which of those banged-up foreigners actually presents a threat to Britain's security? Are you worried about how much it will cost to ensure they don't pop down to the newsagents for a copy of Jane's Weapons of Mass Destruction? Then call the CIA's TerroristBusters! No, the Backbencher isn't joking. If you only do one thing this evening, print out <a href="http://www.cia.gov/terrorism/buster.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and stick it in your window. The terrorists will know which side you're<br />on. And so will Charles.</i></blockquote>

From <a href="http://tech.nytimes.com/pages/technology/index.html" target="_blank"> The New York Times technology pages</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>When the Sous-Chef Is an Inkjet</b><br /><br />HOMARO CANTU'S maki look a lot like the sushi rolls served at other upscale restaurants: pristine, coin-size disks stuffed with lumps of fresh crab and rice and wrapped in shiny nori. They also taste like sushi, deliciously fishy and seaweedy.<br /><br />But the sushi made by Mr. Cantu, the 28-year-old executive chef at Moto in Chicago, often contains no fish. It is prepared on a Canon i560 inkjet printer rather than a cutting board. He prints images of maki on pieces of edible paper made of soybeans and cornstarch, using organic, food-based inks of his own concoction. He then flavors the back of the paper, which is ordinarily used to put images onto birthday cakes, with powdered soy and seaweed seasonings.<br /><br />At least two or three food items made of paper are likely to be included in a meal at Moto, which might include 10 or more tasting courses. Even the menu is edible; diners crunch it up into a bowl of gazpacho, creating Mr. Cantu's version of alphabet soup.<br /><br />Sometimes he seasons the menus to taste like the main courses. Recently, he used dehydrated squash and sour cream powders to match a soup entree. He also prepares edible photographs flavored to fit a theme: an image of a cow, for example, might taste like filet mignon...</i></blockquote><br />- - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />And from the same section of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/specials/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>After death, a struggle for their digital memories</b><br /><br />Stationed in a remote corner of Iraq, Marine Corps reservist Karl Linn's only means of communicating with the outside world was through a computer. Several times a week, the 20-year-old combat engineer would log on and send out a batch of e-mails and update a Web site with pictures of his adventures.<br /><br />For his parents in Midlothian, Va., the electronic updates were so precious that when he was killed last week in an enemy ambush, one of the first things they did was to contact the company that hosted their son's account. They wanted to know how to access the data and preserve it.<br /><br />But who owns the material is a source of intense debate.<br /><br />Linn's father, Richard, said he believes the information belongs to his son's estate, just like his old high school papers, his sweaters and his soccer ball, and should be transferred to the next of kin. The e-mail and Web hosting company, Mailbank.com Inc., said that while it empathizes with the family's situation, its first priority is to protect the privacy of its customers. It refuses to divulge any information about the accounts.<br /><br />As computers continue to permeate our lives, what happens to digital bits of information when their owners pass away has become one of the vexing questions of the Internet age. Much of that data are stored in accounts on remote servers and have no physical manifestation that can be neatly transferred. There are no clear laws of inheritance, meaning that Internet providers must often decide for themselves what is right.</i></blockquote>

From <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/02/02/wkitk02.xml" target="_blank">The Daily Telegraph</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Exam fever gives Japan a craving for Kit Kat</b><br /><br />The makers of Kit Kat are struggling to cope with a surge in demand for the chocolate bar in Japan, because the country's teenagers believe that it will help them pass exams.<br /><br />Kit Kat, an expression invented in Britain in the 1930s, sounds eerily close to "kitto katsu," a Japanese exam-season mantra that literally means "I'll do my best to make sure I succeed".<br /><br />The quirk of language has provoked a run on the snack.<br /><br />Tens of thousands of students' lunch boxes will contain the bar this month, put there either by ambitious parents anxious for their offspring's success or by the nervous children themselves.<br /><br />Nestlé Japan has noticed previous surges in sales of the product, which is Britain's most popular chocolate bar. This year the company has made an extra effort to sweeten the tough process of getting into a Japanese university.<br /><br />And to appeal to more Japanese youngsters – who are notoriously keen on sweet foods – the company has introduced a range of flavours that Rowntree never dreamed of back in 1937 when it launched the chocolate.<br /><br />As well as the traditional red and white packaging of the familiar four-fingered bar, Japan's Kit Kats also come in lemon cheesecake, passion fruit, white chocolate and even green chocolate flavour. The latter tastes of that Japanese staple, green tea.<br /><br />In the past, students preparing to sit dreaded "juken" entrance examinations for both high school and university would be served "katsudon" – breaded pork cutlets served over rice – as a good luck meal before the big day.<br /><br />But as with much else in Japanese culture, this homegrown tradition has been forced to make way for a western import.<br /><br />"We're finding that parents are buying them for their children for exam days, but also some determined pupils are buying Kit Kats for themselves as a sort of reminder that they are really going to give these exams their best shot," said Yuko Iwasaki, a spokesman for Nestlé Japan.<br /><br />Initially produced by Rowntree as the Chocolate Crisp, Kit Kat is believed to take its name from the famous 1920s club of the same name in London.</i></blockquote>
