  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99">HOW I SPENT MY BLOGDAY</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Quick quick, I must get this 
    in before the clock strikes midnight. Below is a picture story of my day without 
    details. If you want details, here are details:<br>
    <br>
    After Waterloo I went to the natural food store in Camden Town to buy some 
    natural food and on the way it started to drizzle so I opened my umbrella 
    and the sleeve, what do you call that condom thing which protects the umbrella 
    and which always gets lost? Anyway it fell and a kind man picked it up and 
    when I turned round to take it I slipped on the wet pavement and went crashing 
    down and had to be pulled upright and then I went limping onwards to the natural 
    store and took my time buying expensive organic shampoo and some food as well 
    but as I was leaving the shop the drizzle became a serious downpour with thunder 
    and I had to wait inside for the sky to calm down but it didn't so I braved 
    the storm cradling my bag in which my beloved camera was cowering in fear 
    and the rain was pelting down mercilessly so I had to take shelter again in 
    a noisy pub where I spent a while studying the names of cocktails like sex 
    on the beach blow job Ferrari etcetera but the rain didn't let up so once 
    again I made a limp for it and got to my bus stop in front of Marks and Spencer 
    where wet people crowded the entrance and when finally my bus arrived I had 
    to cross a river of dirty water and rain was dripping off my jeans but I kept 
    the little camera safe and dry and when I got home the rain stopped and pink 
    blossoms carpeted the ground and I went in and put on dry clothes and made 
    a grog with Calvados and hot water and lumps of sugar held in the mouth to 
    drink thorough and then I sat down here to write this blog for you all who 
    have so sweetly wished me a happy blogday. Thank you.<br>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Decided to participate in the 
    growing net-wide display of what's on bloggers' bookshelves, started (I think) 
    at <a href="http://alifeinwales.typepad.com/a_life_in_wales/2004/04/books.html" target="_blank">A 
    Life in Wales </a> . But since I can't choose what's really &quot;me&quot; 
    because a lot of it is Natalie and there's so much of it, I am including more 
    than one selection - just the tip of the iceberg. We have <i><b>a lot</b></i> 
    of books about <i><b>a lot</b> </i>of things. The eagle-eyed will note that 
    one picture shows four books by our very selves. The paper and wood construction 
    in this first photo is by my late-blossoming artist mother Blanche, and the 
    odd thing in front of it is a bone (probably sheep) I found in the ground 
    at the temple of Zeus on the island of Aegina two years ago. A talisman.<br>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Via <a href="http://ming.tv/" target="_blank">Ming</a> 
    I've just learned about a London meeting of bloggers on <font color="#FFCC99">May 
    12 </font>and I signed up at <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/LoicLondonmay04" target="_blank">Joi 
    Ito's</a> wiki to be included. The list of participants is huge and growing 
    so if any of you are or will be in London, come along. The venue hasn't been 
    decided yet but various restaurants, pubs and park benches are being suggested.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Last night I upgraded my IE 
    browser to 5.1.7 (for Mac OS9.2) and now I can't read my comments. When I 
    click on them, the computer crashes. I wonder if this is another case of if 
    it ain't broke don't fix it? Excuse me while I count to ten.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">April 23, 2004</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99"> WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN OTHER 
    BLOGGERS STEAL FROM YOU?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">In this case, stealing means 
    posting on their site something that you have created, without mentioning 
    that you are the author and without giving a link to your post. This is theft, 
    especially when a copyright notice is shown at the site they're ripping off. 
    As my loyal readers know, I'm only too happy when I see something of mine 
    on your blogs and so far, due credits and links have always been included. 
    But checking my recent stats I discovered two people who, apparently, find 
    such simple courtesy and honesty beyond their grasp.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="blogimages/highgatejpg" width="147" height="186" align="left" name="highgate.jpg">One 
    blog is in Italian:<font color="#FFCC99"> <i>Vampyronika</i></font> (I'm deliberately 
    not linking). The header shows a bare butt and, as she hasn't replied to my 
    letter, I must assume this is her usual response to anyone she steals from. 
    If you try and leave a comment at her site you get a message saying you don't 
    have permission. The cartoon she took from me was the one I posted in Sept.2003 
    after visiting Highgate Cemetery. She's used it alongside an old joke about 
    Karl Marx (13 April 2004).<br>
    <br>
    <img src="blogimages/irrational.jpg" width="149" height="172" align="right" name="irrational.jpg">The 
    other offender's blog is in Portuguese, apart from its title which is <i><font color="#FFCC99">Black 
    Dock</font>. </i>His name is <font color="#FFCC99"><i>Miguel</i></font> and 
    he put my &quot;Rational&quot; cartoon (also posted by me in Sept.2003) at 
    the head of his very long post about the stupidity of human beings (March 
    28 2004).<br>
    <br>
    All I ask of both these people is to include proper credits but neither of 
    them have replied to my e-mail. Some people have the view that stealing a 
    writer or an artist's work is not like 'normal' theft because such work is 
    not real work - like plumbing, for instance. They would never go to a plumber 
    and say &quot;I'm not going to pay you for installing my boiler and I'm going 
    to tell everyone I did it because your work belongs to the world and you should 
    be happy that I allowed you to work in my house&quot;. Yeah right. Well I'm 
    a plumber, a drawing/thinking plumber, and I'm not charging admission to this 
    blog. But if you use me you'd better not abuse me. And telling others what 
    a good service I provide is the least you can do. Capisce <font color="#FFCC99"><i>Vampyronika</i></font>? 
    Voce comprende <font color="#FFCC99"><i>Black Dock</i></font>?</font></p>

    It's not newsworthy but I thought people interested in earth-moving might 
    like to see it. The most fascinating thing about it is that huge chunks of 
    smooth, malleable yellow ochre clay are being dug out of the trenches and 
    will be carted away by the truckload. I'm wondering whether I should stuff 
    some in plastic bags and save it for eventual sculpting. Anyone short of clay?<br>

    is beautiful at this time of year. Nature splashes the drab greys and browns 
    with its palette of inimitable colours, transforming everything. The tree 
    in front of the house next door almost sings its loveliness. Yet I'm feeling 
    sad for all those who cannot glory in the beauty of Spring because they are 
    mourning their dead and weeping for the injured or because their hearts are 
    filled with despair, hatred and revenge. We know the names of the countries, 
    we hear the names of the leaders every day in the news, we discuss the politics, 
    the horrors and the terrors. But the saddest realisation of all is that it 
    goes on and on, over and over again. Humankind crucifies the innocent, always 
    finding reasons to do so, always justifying the unjustifiable. The Passion 
    is played and replayed on the world stage or in small, intimate venues, non-stop.

    only one on my street which is not in full glorious pink, white or yellow

    to his poem-reply, as part of his engaging series of postcard-poems. Check 
    it out and don't miss the next three. I'll be adding a new section here soon 
    for digital graphics and other improvisational/recreational stuff. Can't be 
    talking to God <i>all </i>the time, can I? Or maybe everything is a dialogue.

    now and I've been up all night. Do any newspaper or TV reporters ever stay 
    up this long with their interviewees? If you have a slow connection I'm afraid 
    you'll just have to be patient while this special bonus double installment 
    loads. And if you're a new visitor, all previous episodes are <a href="interviewgod.html">here</a>.
