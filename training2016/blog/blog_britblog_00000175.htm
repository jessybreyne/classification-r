	 Oh one day, when you're lookin' back...
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />The way I see it</span>, you should live your life so that you don't regret things when you are old and grey. This is why I am studying for a PhD - I don't want to look back and think what would have been if I hadn't done one. I could get a shitty job in some faceless firm and make money like it's going out of fashion, but where's the fun in that if you are bored and tired all the time? I'd rather be poor and challenged mentally than well-off and some sort of corporate shyster motherfucker kow-towing to some old fart on the board for a promotion. Bugger that. Give me scary over secure any day. It's 6am, I've stayed up all night talking, drinking and thinking, and the sun is rising over the railway track outside the Battery Farm. It is going to be another glorious day. I am going to see my family on Wednesday, and all my old friends. I couldn't give a fuck what happens in my life; I don't have a plan, I don't have any real set goals (you know, the sort of pointless married-by-30 kids-by-35 etc etc that people tie themselves up in knots about) and I am absolutely sure that whatever I do, I will get there in the end. All I ask for is a few nice sunrises and the odd beer in the sunshine along the way. I reckon there are seriously lucid moments of clarity that hit people several times over in their lives - some are after long dark nights of the soul, some are in the sunrises of spring Sundays. A central tenet of my philosophy is never to ignore your epiphanies - you never know which one is going to be your last. Don't doubt your inspirations, but don't abandon all you have in favour of them. Do what you think you need to do to succeed, but don't burn your bridges on the way. Be happy with yourself, and everything will follow. Get out of your bed instead of lying in until 12 noon at the weekends and regretting it through the week, every week without fail. And write a diary, for pity's sake. Even if it is sort of an exhibitionist/voyeuristic blog type thing; at once the most public and most private sort of journal one can keep. It really helps. This is the third diary I have kept, and the first one to come with its own Atom RSS feed. I kinda like that.<br /><br />Remember please that I am only 22 years old, and will undoubtedly change my tune sometime over the next 22 years, but for now I like how I think. So I'm going to write it down. If it bores or offends or causes stupification, then I apologise. But not in a particulary sincere fashion.<br /><br /><br />And trust me on the sunscreen<br /></div>

	 Who the fuck do these people
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />think they are?</span> The religious neo-conservative movement sickens and angers me at the best of times, and then they go and do something like <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4362679.stm">this</a>, handing a subpoena to a seriously brain-damaged woman, forcing her to go to congress so that she will live on in a state of abject misery. The religious right turned up <span style="font-style: italic;">on her husband's lawn</span>, clapping and shouting and praying (or should that be <span style="font-style: italic;">prey</span>ing?) that she be allowed to suffer further, because "life is sacred". Who are these people to have anything to do with this? I am all for the right of the individual to hold their own beliefs, but the moment they try and force their ideology onto something or someone else, they should be shouted down with all the voracity that the objective can muster. Further to this American debacle, we Brits have managed to have one of our own this week - the party political approach to abortion. The Catholic church (I am <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a fan of the Catholic church) have come out in favour of the Conservative party (I am <span style="font-style: italic;">not  </span>a fan of the Conservative party) because they <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4349581.stm">propose a cut</a> in the legal time-window for abortion. <span style="font-style: italic;">Who are these blinkered old men to deny a woman the right to choose what happens to her own body because of some outmoded ideology?</span> The rights of an unborn child, who has no comprehension of what is going on, should not be put before the rights of a vulnerable grown (or perhaps not so grown) woman who may have suffered terribly at the hands of a rapist or abusive partner in order to lead to the conception of this child. Religion and politics should not mix, and subjects like abortion should not be election issues. The Tories have certainly swung to a new low with this one.<br /><br />On a lighter note, it was the most glorious day I have ever seen today here in my adopted home town - the birds were singing, the bells were ringing, and the groundsmen were mowing the grass at the cricket ground. On the way back from Uni (an absolutely stunning walk downhill) I counted three squirrels, two baby bunnies and a deer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There's hope for the world yet.<br /></div>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span> <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">So I was watching the news</span>, and there was a report claiming that sheep are apparently a lot cleverer than we have initially thought, due to their prowess at recognising emotions and faces. Seems to me, if the sheep are that clever, they'd shut the fuck up and then humans would leave them alone and not do loads of tests on them. We'd just eat them and be done with it. Mmmm.<br />    I presented today! It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, and I walked home with the bunnies hopping and the birds singing and the lovely warm feeling that a couple of pints of Guinness will give you. Spring has truly sprung. Plus the Doc has given me a nice holiday over Easter so that I can fly home and surprise my family, who I have not seen since Christmas. Mother <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> be pleased. Signature will be "thought for the day" stylee for a while, children.<br /><br /><br />If I'm so clever, how come I'm not rich?<br /></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />to a head, as it were.</span> I may, <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> just have secured myself some badass lodgings for next year, meaning that I should be escaping the Battery Farm in July and moving to the burgeoning student district of University Town, with its free parking (try finding it anywhere else in the city, I dare ya) and complete absence of railway tracks outside windows (for me, anyway). Plus, and you must forgive me for being a trifle xenophobic at this point, <span style="font-style: italic;">everyone in the house is British</span>. This means that I will not be woken at 5am by foreign flatmates with fucked body-clocks jabbering away in an incomprehensible language, which is doing for my mental health, good and proper (head flicks sideways with newly-developed nervous tic, accompanied by creaking neck-noise).<br /><br />So, as well as possibly escaping this concrete chicken coop (next to which, by the way, they are just finishing off a block of "luxury" flats, at a cost to the hapless punters of nearly 200 grand. The flats are no further away from the railway than I am. There's one born every minute) I am doing very well in both Matey's thesis re-draft (which is going to bed) and my thesis presentation (which met with muchos approval from The Doc when shown to him midweek). Plus I bought a lovely new Logitech optical mouse with lots of bells and whistles which means that I can atrophy even more muscles when surfing the web, since I no longer have to move it as much. To shamelessly steal the style of Scaryduck, I am this: a lazy gobshite.<br /><br />To those resident in the good old UK, I urge you to turn to Auntie Beeb on a Sunday evening and partake in the very brilliant <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/h/help_999050224.shtml">Help!</a> starring Paul Whitehouse of <span style="font-style: italic;">Fast Show</span> and other things. There will be no mention of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/4340249.stm">rugby</a>. That is all.<br /><br />I think it is time for a new signature, I am tired of Ford and motherfucking. I think, until I can come up with a better one, I shall use the title the album currently in my CD player, since it is a good salutory caution to be used in any situation, especially pertaining to hedonistic activities. We science PhD's really know how to party, y'know.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">When it's all over, we still have to clear up</span><br /></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />For we shall inherit the earth.</span> Still won't get us laid though. My compulsive blogging has been cured recently as I have been eagerly striving to attain the title of "Busiest Man in England". I've got to present what meagre data I have thus far gathered to my thesis committee next week, otherwise PhDmonkey could become JobCentremonkey. Along with this, I am still in the last stages of finding a decent abode for next year (have decided on one that is, in fact pretty ace - ironically it was the first one that I actually looked at but we'll keep that on the down-low, shall we?) and, due to my irrepressible good nature I have agreed to proof-read and redraft my good mate's 12,000 word honours thesis. This turned out to be an even larger undertaking than I had anticipated, as the thesis was shit. But lo! I stayed up till 4am this morning (a Friday night, mark you, when all good men should be in the pub) sustained only by toast, coffee and Muslim Dave's neopolitan ice cream (it's a bit like Ben and Jerry's but judges you for having pre-marital sex and eating bacon sarnies for breakfast), and finished the bastard thing. It's quite good now, if I may say so myself. It struck me that I have been doing "school" work for the best part of two decades now, and the horror set in - I'm not entirely sure I want to stop. I like learning stuff. When I was at primary (elementary) school I used to get dead upset in the summer holidays because nobody would mark what I was doing; I half expected my teacher to turn up at the football field and give me pointers as to how I could redraft my last two goals to make them look more spectacular. I <span style="font-style: italic;">need</span> marks and grades and little certificates - they validate my existence and let everybody know that I am ever so smart. I've got one of those great big latin certificates from my first degree - mother wants to frame it and hang it on the wall at mi casa de padres but I don't know if I am quite at that stage yet. I'm abso-bloody-lutely knackered now, but there is so much sport on the telly today I must watch it all. I must. Where's the Pro-Plus when you need it?<br /><br />Tired of being a chubster?

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span> <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It's official - </span>I am about to move up the chain of command. The Doc came in today and announced that we are getting a new junior doctoral student, ergo I will have someone to boss around. This is a good thing, and a real ego boost for the Monkey. This new student, I will name it PhD Squirrel, and it will be my Squirrel, and Squirrel will be its name. Time, I think, to meet the lab of the PhD Monkey.<br /><br />The Doc: Head of the lab, reader (a senior UK academic position) in his chosen subject and one of the cleverest people I am ever likely to meet. At the same time, he has a wealth of very funny stories, likes the rugby and is a legend down the pub. My PhD supervisor.<br /><br />Research Wombat: The Doc's lieutenant, a slightly eccentric (but very friendly) girl who has recently finished her PhD and is working in the lab as a Post-Doc. Has spent the last seven or eight years in university, studying science, until she was sure that she hated it and wanted to rid herself of it. Wishes to leave ASAP.<br /><br />PhD Gorilla: Senior doctoral student, older and wiser than me. Comes from the Far East and provides a unique take on life here in Blighty, but gets confused by our colloquialisms and peculiarities, leading to all manner of mix-ups, which I may decide to detail in these pages. Gets drunk on half a pint of beer. He's a lovely bloke.<br /><br />PhD Monkey: My "good" self. Junior doctoral student, general lab dogsbody and scourge of the undergraduate. I suppose, dear reader, that it may help to to have a mental picture of me (I do not actually look like a monkey, I just have a similar IQ to one). Erm, I am about 6ft tall, well-built without being fat or jockish, with dark hair, decent teeth and really deep brown eyes which I am told are quite attractive. When I write these posts, dear reader, I always imagine myself reading them out loud (Doogie Howser diary stylee) so for the same experience, you should know that I'm quite well spoken, with a soft-ish middle class Scottish accent (think Ewan McGregor rather than Groundskeeper Willie). Judge me at your will.<br /><br />Honours Minion: Some-time project student in the lab, the only person below me in the hierarchy since my arrival here at the Research Ranch.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ford, you're looking forward to bossing someone around far too much. Stop it.<br /></div>

	 The Feuding Follicles
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />My hair and I</span> do not get on. This is something that we have both understood for quite some time, and we have come to a pact of sorts; I will not try and subject my hair to fashionable styles involving multitudes of chemical "styling" products of varying viscosities and adhesions, and my hair will refrain, as much as possible, from doing Einstein impersonations at short notice. I went to the barber yesterday for what could euphemistically called a "trim" (where my hair is shorn off in spades by a grinning Italian who charges me £10 for fifteen minutes of abject humiliation) and several home truths were brought home to me all at once:<br /><br />1. No matter what I tell my hairdresser to do, he/she will always supply me with the same utilitarian hair-don't (like a hair-do but without the flair).<br /><br />2. The barber's chair is the perfect place to gauge how much weight you have lost/gained in the period since your last trip - this is because you are made to squadge down further and further in the chair so that the diminutive chopper can access your pate; if you are a bit flabby you end up looking like Jabba the Hutt in a cape.<br /><br />3. When they hold the mirror up to the back of your head, what the hell are you supposed to say? It's not like looking at the nape of your neck is an everyday occurrence. I usually manage a sort of "hmmm, yes, it's very nice", leaving the mirror-holder to decide whether I am commenting on the hair-cut or the shape of my noggin from behind.<br /><br />4. You show me a man that can walk home from the barber's without constantly plittering with hair and itching from all the bits that have fallen down his back, and I will show you a truly great human being.<br /><br />5. Getting a haircut sends you into bald-paranoia mode, checking the temples in the mirror and actually trying to look at the top of your head. This has been exacerbated since the advent of the camera phone. Don't tell me you haven't done it.<br /><br />PS Cheers to David Coulthard for his <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4318685.stm">magnificent drive</a> in the fledgling Red Bull F1 car!<br /><br /><br /><br />Ford, your head's looking like an egg dipped in black paint.

Something I have done has finally been indexed by Google - type in Pre-fab Post-grad Battery Farm and see what comes out! Plus people do actually read my blog, even if they all know each other - I suppose some conversation about me over the water cooler at work is out of the question?<br /><br />Actually writing a blog has got me into reading the things religiously - my two favourites are the aforementioned <a href="http://callcentrediary.blogspot.com/">Call Centre Confidential</a>, and the bizarrely British <a href="http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/">Scaryduck</a>. Plus I cannot help but check my stock price on <a href="http://blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fmeaninglessrandomness.blogspot.com%2F&amp;user=26346">Blogshares</a> on a frequent basis after finding it on the Call Centre site. I seem to be taking the writing part very seriously these days - last night I actually sat down and planned what I was going to say today. I am king of nerds. Oh yes. There is nothing wrong with looking forward to the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy film coming out, or knowing where my sig-quote comes from - don't worry <a href="http://thewenchstavern.blogspot.com/">Wench</a>! (By the way, well done on the reviewer gig - could you mail me a copy of what you think? No punches pulled, I hope).<br /><br />Today, my cohorts and I managed to flood our lab good and proper - The Doc was most amused. I reckon I will introduce you to my lab in the next week or so, dear reader. Tonight, I go and see a flat inhabited by (gasp) three girls! Mediterranean-type flatmate 1 is praying that they are all attractive so that he can come and visit on a frequent basis. We will see.<br /><br />Here's to another month!<br /><br /><br /><br />Ford, you've been spouting nonsense for 4 weeks now. Stop it.<br /></div>

Plus the guys who are living there seem like a really good bunch of folk. Trouble is, they probably think I am a psycho because I went into "charm" overdrive which went drastically wrong and ended up with me talking shit for 40 solid minutes. We do not expect a call-back. Ho-hum.<br /><br /><br />PS: Bonkers good results in the lab today. Hurrah!<br />PPS: Someone has put manure on their garden and the air around the Battery Farm smells of shit. Or, more accurately, smells more shitty than normal.<br /><br />Ford, you're struggling to find lodgings. Stop it.<br /></div>
