Too 
much

Need 
something 
to

I'll 
request 
an

with

about

I'll 
make 
him 
an 
offer 
he 
can't 
refuse: 
five 
minutes 
of 
fame 
on 
my 
blog, 
anonymity 
guaranteed. 
When 
I tell 
him 
Dubya

Tony

he's 
sure 
to 
say 
yes. 
Well, 
judging 
by 
Sad's 
taste 
in 
art 
he 
won't 
be 
impressed 
by

- did 
you 
see 
what

that

so 
different

So? 
Like

doesn't 
spend 
her

strutting 
her

one 
way

We

But 
now 
I can 
relax 
and 
let 
the 
adulation 
come. 
Everyone 
wants 
to 
be 
noticed 
(except 
spies, 
assorted 
wrong-doers 
etc.) 
but 
when 
people 
become 
celebrities, 
they 
want 
to 
be 
left 
alone! 
I avoid 
the 
problem 
by 
remaining 
nearly 
famous. 
No 
bodyguards, 
no 
doubles, 
no 
worries. 
I can 
go 
to 
the 
supermarket 
and 
not 
be 
mobbed. 
My 
autograph 
is 
only 
requested 
on 
credit 
card 
vouchers. 
What 
am 
I saying? 
Alter 
egos 
don't 
have 
credit 
cards. 
Speaking 
of 
fame, 
I sometimes 
wonder 
what 
my 
beloved 
Van 
Gogh 
would 
have 
done 
with 
it 
had 
it 
happened 
in 
his 
lifetime? 
H'mm..... 
This<I>

be 
a good 
subject

.So 
I sent 
him 
my 
thoughts 
on 
this 
topic, 
the 
booklet 
<I>Augustine

He 
graciously 
replied, 
inviting 
Natalie 
to 
visit 
in 
Oxfordshire. 
I had 
considered 
illustrating 
his 
ideas 
my

was 
very

things 
up

when

She 
sent 
him 
some 
sample 
illustrations, 
digitalclever 
stuff. 
Of 
course 
he 
wasn't 
impressed 
and 
anyway 
he's 
got 
other 
things 
on 
his 
mind. 
So 
that 
was 
the 
end
