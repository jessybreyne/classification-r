          <strong>Falafels and Windex</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />Those were my suggestions used at comedysportzes. I totally stumped them on falafel. They did not know how to pantomime a falafel. Instead they pantomimed alfalfa via the little rascals and hoped that somehow falafel would spring out of it... but to no avail.<br /><br />So, quick school update. UCLA was fun. Got official word of my acceptance at Davis and Berkeley. And have been hearing unofficial news at UCLA and Stanford. As it stands, here are the probabilities of my going to each particular school (this is pretty optimistic):<br /><br />Stanford-65%<br />Davis-20%<br />UCLA-10%<br />Berkeley-5%<br /><br />Eh, these probabilities will likely change. For example, on Wednesday of last week it was more like Berkeley-40%, UCLA-20%, Davis-15%, Stanford-15%. The point being, I have no clue where I will be for the next 6 years of my life. I will discontinue this line of thought.<br /><br />I've got a stochastic processes midterm on Tuesday. Damn.<br /><br />Saw Geetha at UCLA on Friday. I was wearing a loud shirt. I was interviewing with a postdoc at the time in the lobby of the life sciences building so I waved to Geetha as she walked in. She said "Are you finished with your interviews". And I was all "actually I'm interviewing currently, geetha meet so and so, so and so meet geetha". HA ha. Well I thought it was funny.<br /><br />Andrew and I went to Denny's late Friday night. Denny's rocks. Andrew is taking an interpersonal communications class. It doesn't show.<br /><br />Nonstop. Nonstop. Nonstop to Tokyo.<br /><br />I saw the lead singer guy from the band in Almost Famous (Dogstar? or is that Keanu Reeves's band?). He was standing behind me in the Southwest line at the Burbank airport. I looked at him, turned back around, realized I recognized him, turned around again to get another look, then turned back around, then turned BACK around to get a third look and I finally realized where I recognized him from. At his point he was sort of sneering at me because I kept turning around to look at him. So I went to go check my bags.<br /><br />I was in L.A. for less than two days and still saw a movie star. Freakin L.A., the whole gosh darn city is fake.<br /><br />So now I'm spending the day with Marie.  I'm at the furd currently.  She's reading a romance novel and I'm avoiding stochastic processes, for I fear all that is aperiodic and irreducible.  Anyway, I'm enjoying the day.  Has been and shall be quite relaxing and refreshing.<br /><br />I would like to dedicate this to all of you who have courage. And that concludes this day's edition of Stupid Ball with Tim, the man.

          <strong>Ahoy Ahoy</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />So, I've been at Stanford since Wednesday interviewing for the PhD program.  It's been quite fun although ridiculously stressful.  So there were 19 of us interviewing for like 7 spots.  I was also the only person there still pursuing a B.S. and not having a Masters already.  Also, almost everyone there had some combination of Oxford, Harvard, Princeton, and Cambridge for there Bachelors and Masters.  So I was a bit intimidated.  But I enjoyed myself.<br /><br />Yesterday, as Marie mentioned, Stanford payed for me and like 10 other of the prospective students to go up into the mountains (not Napa alas) to do some wine tasting.  I had never been, unless you count watching your parents do wine tasting, so that was fun.  Then we went down to the beach and played soccer for a number of hours.  Twas most fun.<br /><br />So anyway, yeah,  I expect to hear word from Stanford on Monday about whether I made the "last cut".  Basically all the faculty get into a room and argue who they want to be admitted.  Fortunately I have a number of faculty on my side but I do not know if it is enough.  ANYway...<br /><br />I'm going to UCLA on Thursday to meet with some people there about grad school.  I'm beginning to lean towards UCLA actually.  Though I haven't heard from any of the schools I've applied to formally, I've been given hints of funding offers and it seems that UCLA would be willing to give me the best deal (for the exception of Stanford).  So if I like the people I meet on Friday and the stipend is as good as I've been told it is then I may end up at UCLA after all. <br /><br />Basically all this will begin to finally piece together within the next couple of weeks so I'm really anxious and excited to hear offers from everyone and to finally be able to make a decision.<br /><br />Well, this has been good for me to be able to straighten out my thoughts.  Now for something completely different.<br /><br />Interviewing at Stanford has had its plusses.  Basically I've been able to hang out with Marie all week.  And boy do we love french fries.  I think we've bought fries like every single day this week.  At least I've bought fries (which Marie then steals) like every day.  At rate, fries rock.<br /><br />News seems to have slowed to a halt as of late.  The whole Lebanon thing happened and then the next day everyone was like "Michael Jackson's defense has denied the admission of blah blah blah!"  Man, I so don't care.  Or how about Martha Stewart, been hearing a lot about her a lot lately.  And that's all I have to say about that.<br /><br />I met a girl from Caltech at the interview weekend.  I asked if she knew a guy named David.  She said she didn't know.  I said "He's really... loud".  She said no.  And I was dissappointed.<br /><br />OH YEAH!  Then, there was this girl who at the wine tasting who was wearing a "Pretenders" shirt.  And I was like, awesome!  So I went up to her and was like...<br /><br />"The Pretenders are awesome, Chrissy Hines rocks!"<br /><br />and she was all "I don't know who the Pretenders are.  I just like the shirt."<br /><br />And I was dissappointed.  It reminded me of all the girls who walk around Berkeley with "The Ramones" shirts wearing like pink capris with it or something, who clearly have know idea who the Ramones are.  Bah.  But the Pretenders shirt took me by suprise. <br /><br />Ok, I think that's enough for now.

          <strong>Fear in Venezuela</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />Venezuela is all over the news these days.  Venezuelan baseball players are reported to have many guards when they go home for fear of kidnapping.  President Chavez has pointed a finger at the U.S. saying that if he's assinated (by the U.S.) then there will be hell to pay.<br /><br />It's interesting to hear of all this on this side, the U.S. side.  In fact I was warned about U.S. assination attempts when I was down there in the summer.  I was told not to speak of U.S. politics at all because Venezuelans were very angry with Americans and might take it out on me.  I was pretty scared down there.  Fortunately I lived far from civilization on a cattle ranch but was far enough from the Columbian border that I didn't really have to worry about the FARC or anything.  So that type of thing was in my favor.  But going into Caracas... I had a day to spend there and sight see but I opted to just hide in my hotel room the whole day instead. <br /><br />But back here in the U.S. it's all but a blip on the radar screen.  Being in the U.S. I think we are VERY isolated from world opinion (I know I am, I mean, I'm not fearing for my life anymore) and I just hope that it doesn't come around to bite us in the ass.  People often forget that Syria, North Korea, and Iran aren't the only nations who hate us.
