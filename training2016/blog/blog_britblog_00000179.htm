      Before I talk my usual nonsense, check out <br /><a href="http://www.zyworld.com/cameraman/iremembernothing.htm ">Martin O'Neill's wonderful photos of Joy Division playing Bowden Vale</a><br />because they really are wonderful. Seriously. We have one... "Bowden Vale Eighteen".<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I had the most wonderful bubble bath before; full, ideal temperature and extremely bubbly. It was perfect. I have never felt so chilled out in my life… or in the last six months, anyway. It made me feel all warm and happy… blissful. <br />Because of this, I’ve decided that this week is going to be my week of rest. This means that I’m going to do anything I possibly can to relax at any given opportunity… I need to. I've been so stressed and tired recently.<br /><br />Therefore...<br />I’m going to have a huge, luxurious bubble bath every night before I go to bed…<br />I’m going to waste several hours lusting after stunning clothes in magazines…<br />I’m going to treat myself to some beautiful new underwear; French knickers and ribbons…<br />I’m going to wear my loveliest clothes and my favourite red lipstick all week…<br />I’m going to dance around my room and lie on my bed listening to my favourite music…<br />I’m going to buy a huge bouquet of lilies for my bedroom…<br />I'm going to get the train to a city I've never been to before with some friends and just wander round all day, shop and go to a coffee shop and have nice cake and coffee...<br />I’m going to sleep lots and lots so that I can enjoy every minute of the day without a hint of tiredness…<br /><br />I want my week to be the most divine, self-indulgent week I’ve ever had.<br /><br />After that it’ll be work and more work and I’ll be coming straight back down with a bang. But I don’t care. I feel so relaxed right now… I never want this feeling to end.

	 "Manchester's got everything except a beach"
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      I've been busy looking at lots of blogs this evening (because I have the joy of babysitting on this fine Friday night) and the one thing that's really captured my attention is this: <br /><br />Mancunians really are completely obsessed with their city.<br /><br />And I mean it. The majority of sites I see by my fellow inhabitents rarely seem to leave out the fact that THEY ARE FROM MANCHESTER and that they LOVE THEIR CITY. You don't get this with people from Leeds or Hull or Nottingham; why are we different?<br /><br />I'm just as bad, as I also love my city far too much. My city. I think that's part of the reason; Manchester feels like it's yours. It has a buzz and a very close-knit feel to it. Strangers in the chippy will chat to you without a second's thought. If someone is crying in public, people will stop and offer help. Old ladies will give you 20p if you're caught short in the bus queue. Shop assistants recognise you. And somehow - magically - everyone knows each other through other people. There are many links to many people, and you soon realise that Manchester is just a web of people, all joined up (sometimes for the most random reasons). It's classed as a big city, but it feels like a tight-knit community the majority of the time.<br /><br />And then there are the bands, but I won't even bother as you've most definitely heard it all already. Influential, amazing and completely different to anything else are terms that could be used here. And Peter Saville! And then there's the small case of Factory Records and the Hacienda... <br /><br />I know it's the capitol of rain and all that, but Manchester during the summer is the best. There's a chilled atmosphere to the place and everyone tends to look extremely happy. The emo kids gather at Urbis. Randomers from all over gather at Piccadilly Gardens (how different it is to the tramp heaven it used to be!) and kids run around in the fountains getting thoroughly soaked. <br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />There are many more reasons why I love my home. However, I won't go on as those who aren't from here just will not be interested. And I don't blame them.

	 Slugs are evil. Don't even try to argue.
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      It's August 2004 and seriously bloody hot. <br /><br />The garden is crawling with slugs. They're busy spreading their slime throughout, smothering the plants and generally being disgusting. They hide in the grass in the hope that you accidentally sit on them, causing you to rush off screaming; you got slimed! On your arse! They eat your newly-grown lettuces and raddishes. They somehow find their way into the rabbit hutch and decide that actually, food bowls are more comfortable that grass. Your poor rabbits don't dare eat for fear of eating pure slime with slime sauce. They are foul.<br /><br />I decide enough is enough.<br /><br />I raid the fridge; someone once told me that putting alcohol out in the garden kills slugs. Ha! I take out two cans of Stella and six orange plastic plates from a nearby cupboard. Payback time. Armed with my plates, my beer and few sticks, I run out into the garden ready for battle. <br /><br />I first go over to the vegetable patch, where the majority of these slimey twats are. I place down the first of my plates right in the middle of a gathering of them - must be having an evil "let's take over the garden" meeting. I pour a generous amount of lager onto the plate. <br /><br />Now, it's time to catch the damned things.<br /><br />Holding the sticks I brought out, I grab the first slug tightly. Plonk! It falls right into the beer. It thinks it's in heaven. I go on, collecting more and more. They just keep on coming! But wait, they're all escaping... I grab another plate and place it face down on top of this one. Ha, they can't escape now! I carry on, and set up more beer stations just like this one, catching every single slimy twat that comes my way. I laugh, both victoriously and nervously. Slugs scare the fucking shit out of me.<br /><br />As I run around the garden, scared to death, my mother comes out. She points out that I am being highly sadistic, taking pleasure out of torturing harmless slugs. But you don't understand, I exclaim, they are evil! <br /><br />I take a look around the garden. There are orange plates swimming with beer and slugs everywhere. Jesus.<br /><br />The next morning I go outside to observe the results of my hard work. I look at every plate in confusion. They are dry as a bone, for a start. Wait...<br /><br />The slugs have fucking drank my beer and buggered off.<br /><br />The slimey twats.

      THE STONE ROSES<br /><br />Yes, it's cliched. Yes, I could have found a more obscure, equally as good band to write about. No, I don't know many teenagers who don't like them. BUT, while I have loads of favourite bands and could go on about them all if I wanted to, I had to choose these for one major reason; the Roses were the band responsible for properly getting me into music, for causing me to be the awkward little twat that I am when it comes to people asking what I like. I’ve loved them for years, and I always will.<br /><br />It all started after a family day out at Blackpool Pleasure Beach donkeys years ago. We were driving home but got stuck in bad traffic on the prom, as it was the time of year where the Illuminations are up, and it was pretty late so we were all knackered. My mum put on a tape to prevent us from drifting off. It was the first time I’d ever listened to it from start to end, taking every detail in. That particular tape changed a part of me, to be pathetically cheesy. It was The Second Coming.<br /><br />Yep. The Second Coming. But before you start, I don’t care what you think; I love it. Ok, there are a few tracks that aren’t too fantastic compared to those like ‘I Wanna be Adored’, but it is a brilliant LP. Go and re-listen to ‘Breaking Into Heaven’ the whole way through, and then tell me I’m not right. <br /><br />So it was there that the obsession began. I nicked my parents’ copy of the CD and listened to it on my earphones religiously every morning on the way to school. I’d grown up with all this music, but it was only at that point that I started to properly take notice. As we were in year 6, my mates were into the Spice Girls and Westlife and I never truly understood it. To be honest, the Roses gave me a way out from all that, an alternative to the shit that was around. I was only about eleven at the time. <br /><br />I went on to get my very own copy of the fantastic self-titled ‘lemon’ album for Christmas. That was what sold it for me. I’d found the most important band in the world, the best band in the world, and I now had this amazing record to prove it. This wasn’t my parents’ copy that I’d grown up hearing; I now had a copy of my own. I listened to it in my room every day and night for an unbelievably long time. From ‘I Wanna Be Adored’ to ‘I Am The Resurrection’, it was consistently amazing, and unlike anything I’d ever heard before at that age. I fell for that album, completely head over heels.<br /><br />I can’t really describe what it is about the Roses that I love (my first love?), but they just had ‘it’. I don’t even know what ‘it’ is, but I guess it’s something that makes a band special and unique, something that makes you want to listen to their music 24/7. The Roses that did the ‘lemon album’ were four individuals who were all brilliant at what they did, and who combined this in a way so they could make music that would affect thousands of young people like me for years to come. If you don’t believe me, watch the video of the Blackpool Empress Ballroom gig. If there’s any gig I wish I’d been at, that’s the one. The venue is spectacular but the band, live, were even more so.<br /><br />The Stone Roses made bloody amazing music that had something different about it. So many bands lack that difference, that attitude and importance these days. They should learn from the Roses; it would do them wonders.

      Only just got my comp back after some nasty virus decided to take it over last week and make it go funny. Wouldn't mind but it's being very weird now and there's no editor bar in the compose mode - won't be able to change the font!<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />I've been a bitch this past week. First of all, cancelled Rai on The Bravery the night before the gig, meaning that she had to sort out someone to go with her last minute or she would have been on her own, then basically sent her some very cold text messages asking for the money to give to the guy I got the tickets off. For no reason whatsoever. I've got flu but that's no excuse. <br /><br />I do that. 99% of the time I'm joking around, having a laugh. All I want is to have fun - basically, I'm happiest when I'm laughing. Then something will happen that touches a nerve and it bothers me, so I take it out on someone else. I can be pretty nasty. Not, like, really fucking horrible. I'll just make comments that I know would bother me. Why do I do it?? Insecure... I don't do it often, but I really fucking hate it when I do. I care about and love my mates so much; they're fantastic. I just can't deal with opening up to anyone. I don't want to, really. I've got no real problems so there's no need. Sort of.<br /><br />She; "the mad one", "the one with the great dress sense", "the one who always has something to say", "the one with the fab taste in music". <br />She; the one who really needs to sort her fucking head out.<br /><br />Anyway! After having lost 'Taking Tiger Mountain' over six months ago and having serious cravings, I downloaded 'The True Wheel' by the fantastic Brian Eno. I am now a happy bunny: tis one of my favourite songs in the world. It's proper 'driving with the windows down in the summer with the stereo turned right up' music. I love it, I love it, I love it! It makes me want to dance my arse off. I have listened to it far too many times already. As soon as I've bought my Leeds ticket I'm buying the album again cos hearing this has made me miss it even more.<br /><br />I love the way that listening to 30 seconds of a tune can completely transform your mood, whether it's for better of for worse. In the case of 'The True Wheel' it's sooooo for better. Ahhhh... <br /><br />It's almost summer! Sort of. It's the last day of February tomorrow, anyway. We're getting there, people.<br /><br />Ooooh, I sorted out my room today. It's tidy (shock horror) and I stuck up loads of photos on my walls... My cross-prossessed Lomo ones from Christmas, my London ones, the ones from Llanbedr summer 2004, ones from years ago... it made me very happy. I did that while listening to Kings of Convenience's wonderful 'Riot on an Empty Street' which made me even moreso. It's the happiest, prettiest, smiliest music I own... <br /><br />See. Moodswings!<br /><br />She<br />x

I don't half talk shit under the influence, and that was at nine in the bloody morning. Ah well. Just, you know, ignore it. Sort of. I'm not all there, and I think that made it pretty clear!</span>

      <span style="font-family:courier new;">Random Fall lyric for you there. As I write it’s 9:15am. I have woken up drunk and won’t go downstairs because it’s pretty obvious… real lack of co-ordination here. Bloody whiskey. Therefore I’m writing on my laptop and will post afterwards seeing as I don’t have the luxury of an Internet connection. This will probably take me forever to write as even when intoxicated I am fussy about grammar, spelling and so forth. Figured what I wanted was to listen to Franz Ferdinand on my headphones full-blast, so here I am, listening to ‘Matinee’. Jesus. The sun is shining through my window and my room’s all orange. I feel dizzy. Everything’s bright. And despite the fact that I feel incredibly weird, I feel good. My outfit looked fucking great last night… I love red lipstick, and the sequined headband was wonderful. Those shoes are my favourite shoes in the entire world. We danced all night and drank far too much. They played ‘Panic’ and Laura didn’t dance (shock, horror - seriously!), despite her love of singing the line “hang the DJ” repeatedly. Had a dream about being in London with all the people at the party last night and having my ears pierced while there. Random.<br /><br />Hang on, am going to get some breakfast.<br /><br />On second thoughts, that is an extremely bad idea.<br /><br />I feel like such a child, writing about this. It’s like I’ve never been to a party before… it’s mad. But yeah, the ex and me sorted things out and it’s all good. We kind of understand each other now and both agree about the fact that we should have stayed mates rather than jumping into a relationship (he asked me out pretty quickly). We sat and chatted for a bit about Doves and whatnot. Just feel so much better now, you know. Like I said to him, when we used to chat on the phone or in person or whatever it was great because we really did get on well, having a laugh and all that, but as soon as we ever got all couply it was just weird and awkward. I know for me it just didn’t feel right. He was very touchy-feely from the minute we went out, and normally that wouldn’t be the slightest problem for me, but with him it was just a bit strange. Don’t get me wrong; I know there was attraction but I just think he was more like a mate. Then when he went weird at Blackpool he freaked me out, so I also went weird, trying hard to make it work where I should have just ended it. I knew there was something wrong, I just don’t tend to give on these kinds of things; I always try unless the situation does seem completely hopeless. I really wasn’t happy, though. But hey, everything is cool, at last. I really genuinely think we can be mates, and I’m very glad bout that.<br /><br />Listening to ‘God’s Cop’ full-volume. God, I love this tune. I was telling Liz last night, when I was eleven years old I used to put Happy Mondays, New Order, Electronic etc on really fucking loud and just dance. No hairbrush and no pretending I was on stage; I just danced. I was sad like that. But hey, I love dancing. I probably look like a twat at parties but who gives a shit? I certainly don’t. If I’m having fun then it’s okay with me. My old room was great, in the flat. Was very small, but so cute. I just have such a vivid memory of me sticking on the 12” version of ‘Loose Fit’ so loud that the bass was really distorted, and really fucking dancing. I would have been in year 7 at the time. Mad. Ooooooh, I’ve just put that on right now. The 12” is so fucking good. Squirrel and G-Man… is a bloody brilliant album too. Ahhh, I love the Mondays. They go back a long way for me. Grown up with the Mondays.<br /><br />Never mentioned before; I bought ‘Goodbye Little Rose’ by The Little Flames from Rough Trade when we were in London. Fabulous. A band that will be great, and they’re all so good-looking. The girl is beautiful and the guys are gorgeous. Any of the guys would do me fine, but the girl is even more stunning. Maybe it’s just the video. Anyhoo. It’s shocking. Great band, great tune.<br /><br />There’s a really irritating strip of light coming from a gap in the curtains falling on my hands as I type. Urgh. Can’t be arsed to close the gap.<br /><br />Think it’s time to listen to a bit of the wonderful and frightening band that is The Fall. What song to choose? ‘Big New Prinz’! Tune. I also love The Fall lots and lots. Wonderful… I have now decided, this is my current favourite song. Hadn’t listened to it since before Christmas and it’s got even better.<br /><br />I’m so glad last night happened. It re-broke the ice with a lot of people, and seeing as we’re camping with them at Leeds, that makes things lots easier. Things got sorted and I got to speak to people who I haven’t spoken to for ages. Hmm. Also, will say here that I fancy this guy I got accused of liking in, like, November (I did). He’s very flirtatious and sweet and has always been like that with me, but don’t know whether he’s like that with everyone or what. Will have to find out. But yes, he’s very cute.<br /><br />Isn’t the term ‘fancy’ such a strange term? Like, “ooh, I fancy some of that”. Maybe not, but I feel like an eight year old saying it.<br /><br />God. I want to start or join a band so badly. Getting sick of this now. Have wanted to be in a one since I was very little. It’s, like, my only proper ambition apart from the fashion stuff. I’ve got to make it happen this year. We’d do a fabulous cover of ‘At Home he’s a Tourist’ and be really bloody brilliant. Someone…<br /><br />In the meantime, please send me evenings and weekends.<br /><br />Don’t think I can write any more. My brain’s actually dissolved.</span>

      <span style="font-family:courier new;">Just reading a post by Jonny Genius made me have an instant desire to go stick on Solid Gold, so here I am, typing and grooving (I didn't really just say that, honest) to the wonderful tune that is 'Paralysed'. Now; Solid Gold or Entertainment!... seriously difficult to choose. Saying that, I don't think it can get as good as 'He'd Send in the Army', so I'll have to say Solid Gold at the mo... Either way, wonderful, wonderful band. Have to say, though, The The, Electronic and New Order are still permanent fixtures on my stereo. Bring on the wonderful '80s music; loving it.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">Outfit for tomorrow night currently stands at dark low-cut shirt, fuschia silk scarf, purple satin skirt with silver pattern on, black tights, my Irregular Choice glitter pumps with the platform-type soles and my gorrrgeous dark purple faux-fur coat with my '50s brooch. And then a purple sequined stretch headband and lovely red lipstick. Going for the usual She-style eclectic brightly-coloured thing. Typical really, but I love clothes and dressing up sooo much. I need a haircut again. The thing with me is that whatever the event, however big or small, planning my outfit is the thing I get most excited about nine times out of ten. I just love talking about clothes. I'm me.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;">Can't believe it's weekend again. Where the fuck is time going at the moment? I may sound like an old lady, but seriously, it's disappearing before you can even take the time to blink. If that makes any sense whatsoever. But anyhoo. Work as usual tomorrow. It's bloody lucky I like my job (I work in an art shop) or else I'd be manically depressed by now. Having only one day off does take its toll. But still, the shop is great, the people I work with are lovely and it's got a really laid-back atmosphere. It's in the centre of town, which is seriously helpful when it comes to getting last-minute outfits for Saturday nights out, and I also happen to get a third off all goods which is pretty bloody handy... But yeah, meeting Fran in my lunch for coffee at Caffe Nero (mm, Mocha) and will probably discuss how to act around immature exes and the quickest and cheapest ways of getting rather legless. Lovely.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;">Ooh, got itinerary for the America trip next year. Three nights in New York, and staying in Manhattan! Then moving onto Philadelphia and Washington. Can't bloody wait. Anyways...</span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;">Jesus, it feels like ages since I've been to a party. It's not at all, but I've been so busy lately it just seems like another time in my life altogether. Almost. I'm just itching to do something new. Something creative and interesting. Anything. I've wanted to start a band since I was tiny so, as usual, that's on my list. But there's other things. I want to go places, see things, hear things... I want to do some amazing art, something that is completely different to anything else. If I was in a band, it would have to be completely individual. I want to make my own clothes - which I'm now starting to do and loving it. To say that 'I Wanna be Adored' wasn't appropriate here would be a lie, though I hate admitting that. But now I'll shut up; I sound silly.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;">I don't want much out of life. Really.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;">Ha.</span>

Very chuffed. Shitloads of work to do tonight though, wish I hadn't left it all so bloody late... Ah well.<br /><br />Andy's party on Saturday... should be a laugh. Heard from several people now that the ex is actually scared of me - he shouldn't flatter himself! - and actually does want to talk. So he wasn't just being incredibly rude, as I'd thought. Will wait and see, but you know... Men are silly sometimes. I can't really be arsed but when you're sitting in a group then it can get kind of awkward.<br /><br />This guy I know is going out with this girl, right, and I don't know her at all, but I realised today that I think I've actually spoken to her before at some party or another really quite recently. But I have no idea where or when. Maybe it's not her I'm thinking of; he was there at the time, too, and they didn't pay the blindest bit of attention to each other! Hmm. God, I hate it when that happens.<br /><br />My entries are full of shit at the moment. So fucking tired.
