<h1>Electronic Voting Hot List</h1>

<p class="highlight">This page contains a list of links to Internet sites with
electronic-voting related information.  It is intended as a resource list for
those doing research on electronic voting and those  interested in
implementing electronic voting systems.</p>

<p>When I first started compiling this list I included only links related to
electronic voting over public computer networks.  However, I have since added
links to a variety of related issues.</p>

<p>Let me know if you find a good link I missed. Please send suggestions for
additional links to <a
href="mailto:lorrie@acm.org">lorrie@acm.org.</a> Sorry there are so
many broken links here, I haven't had time to do a thorough update in
a while.
</p>

<p>'New to this subject and wondering what you should read first?
Here's what I recommend:</p>

<h2>Available Online Voting Systems</h2>

<p>While there's been a lot of research on electronic voting systems, there
isn't much software available that you can purchace or download and use to run
an election immediatly. The systems described in this section may be useful to
those running an election for a non-governmental organization.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.deliberate.com/">eVote</a> - voting
    software designed to be used in conjunction with the Majordomo electronic
    mailing list system. As of August 1998, a shareware version was available
    for Majordomo running under Linux. It costs $80 to register.  According to
    the Web site, the authors will also do custom ports to other operating
    systems and mailing list managers for a fee.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.trueballot.com/">TrueBallot, Inc. Democratic

    products, but they do offer electronic voting booth, vote-by-mail, and
    vote-by-phone products for use in non-governmental elections</li>

  <li>Other solutions for running a non-governmental election:
    <ul>
      <li>Call up your local governmental election office and see if you can
        borrow voting equipment from them.</li>
      <li>Hire someone (perhaps a computer science student from a local
        college) to setup a Web-based system for your group.</li>

    appears to be the first US political party to allow voters to cast their
    ballots via the Internet (or telephone or postal mail or in person at the
    convention).  However, they make no promises about privacy. According to a
    party spokesperson, 1.13 million ballots were sent out, and 2500 people
    attended the convention.  Ballots were returned as follows: 43,202 paper
    ballots (by mail or at convention), 3963 telephone ballots, 2101 Internet
    ballots.  It's interesting to note that most of the ballots were mailed,
    despite the fact that voters had to supply their own postage!  There were
    toll free numbers for telephone voting, but they were not printed in the
    voting instructions (they were announced at the convention, on CNN, and in
    press reports).</li>

<h2>Vote by Mail</h2>

<p><i>Although this is not directly related to electronic voting, this section
is included because it deals with an alternative form of voting that is
starting to gain acceptance for governmental elections.  Studying the path to
acceptance of vote-by-mail may provide insight into how electronic voting may
