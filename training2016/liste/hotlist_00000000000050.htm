<p><title>U.S. Government Hotlist</title>Francis Scott Key wrote the poem <I>The Star Spangled Banner</I>
on September 13, 1814. It was originally entitled <I>Defence of Fort
M'Henry</I>. Soon after, it was set to music. It became our official
national anthem in 1931. Do you know all the words?</P>
