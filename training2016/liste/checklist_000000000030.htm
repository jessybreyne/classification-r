    are several possible defenses to a claim of defamation, although none may 
    apply in a particular case. Check one of the following defenses only if you 
    are fairly certain it would apply.</font></h2>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Nevertheless, truth is usually a complete defense to an action for libel.  You must ask yourself though, do we want to get ourselves into a lawsuit to prove it?">
    The statement or other material is <strong>true</strong>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Nevertheless, repeating what anyone in attendance at an official public meeting would have heard, or what anyone could see in a public record, is not generally actionable.">
    The statement or other material is a <strong>fair report</strong> of an official 
    or public record or proceeding.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Nevertheless, an expression of opinion is not generally actionable so long as it does not imply that there are undisclosed defamatory facts underlying the opinion.  Ask yourself whether the reader would likely conclude that the author must know something (in order to hold the opinion) the reader doesn't know, and that &quot;something,&quot; were it printed explicitly, would likely be defamatory.">
    The statement or other material is <strong>purely</strong> an expression of 
    <strong>opinion</strong> and not an assertion of fact.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Nevertheless, fair comment, like opinion, is not generally actionable.  It might be best to apply the &quot;underlying defamatory facts&quot; test to fair comment, just as it is applied to opinion.  Ask yourself whether the reader would likely conclude that the author must know something (in order to hold the opinion evidenced in the commentary) the reader doesn't know, and that &quot;something,&quot; were it printed explicitly, would likely be defamatory.">
    The statement or other material constitutes a <strong>fair comment - that 
    is, a comment or opinion on a matter of public concern</strong>, for example, 
    the use of public money, disbarment of attorneys, management of public institutions 
    and charities, management of private companies whose activities widely affect 
    the public (pollution, delivery of medical services, common carriage, employment 
    practices, discrimination, etc.) or the review of books, public entertainment, 
    sports events or scientific discoveries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Nevertheless, if the person identified by the material is a public person or a politician, somthing in the nature of a parody or caricature should not be a problem.  If the identified person is a private individual, courts are less tolerant.">
    <strong>No one could</strong> reasonably <strong>interpret the statement</strong> 
    or image <strong>to be an assertion of</strong> actual <strong>fact</strong> 
    about the person or entity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Keep in mind, however, that harmless name-calling or vague descriptions like, &quot;He's a jack-ass,&quot; have to be tolerated.">
    The statement or image can be characterized as <strong>mere words of abuse</strong>, 
    indicating dislike for the person or entity, but does not suggest any specific 
    charge.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <input type="radio" name="Def" value="Nevertheless, consent is an absolute defense and no editing should be required.">
    The subject of the statement or image has given <strong>consent</strong> to 
    or approved the material. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The fact 
    that material has already been printed somewhere else is not a defense except<br>
    in the narrow fair report circumstance. Republication of a libel creates another 
    libel.</strong></font></p>
