          <H3><A NAME="MAIN">User Testing Techniques - <BR>
          A Reader-Friendliness Checklist</A></H3>
          <HR>
          Periodic user testing is an important element in 
          developing and maintaining a reader-friendly Website. 
          But formal usability tests are expensive and 
          time-consuming&nbsp;-- often prohibitively so. 
          Happily, inspection-based user testing methods, 
          ranging from a free-form
          <A HREF="35283.html">site review</A> to 
          more structured approaches, provide a 
          cost-effective means of assessing (and thus improving) 
          the usability of almost any Website.

          <P>
          One of the most effective forms of inspection-based 
          user testing involves the use of a "usability checklist." 
          Checklist-based user testing is extremely inexpensive 
          to implement, and requires a surprisingly small number 
          of testers to be effective.  It's also easy to schedule; it 
          can be used at virtually any time throughout the 
          development cycle, from the earliest  prototype screens 
          to a full-blown Website.<P>

          <H4>Setting the Stage</H4>
          Here's the basic method for employing a checklist-based 
          user test.<P>
     
          <STRONG>Step 1. Preliminary Self-Appraisal</STRONG><P>

          No author can view his or her own work with dispassion.  
          Still, there are certain things that inevitably make for an 
          unfriendly Web page.  (See <A HREF= "35248.html">Ten
          Things to Avoid</A> and <A HREF= "35270.html">Ten <EM>More
          </EM> Things to Avoid</A> for examples.)  You can save 
          considerable time, both for yourself and for your
          evaluators, if you start with a basic sweep of your site 
          for known usability problems.  View this self-appraisal as a 
          preliminary step, however, and not as a substitute for 
          user testing methods.<P>

          <STRONG>Step 2: Provide checklists to your testers</STRONG><P>

          The more independent and autonomous your testers are, the 
          more valuable the feedback  they can provide.  A topical site 
          will probably want to enlist the aid of volunteer testers with some 
          interest in the subject of the site.  Corporate sites should 
          strongly consider using agency-based temporary employees 
          for user testing.
          <P>

          One important consideration is: how many testers are 
          enough?  There's no hard-and-fast rule, but inspection-based 
          testing methods provide a surprisingly quick payback, even 
          with a small number of evaluators.  Even a single tester 
          can probably uncover the most common usability problems 
          on your site.  And a handful (4 or 5) is more than adequate 
          to ensure a generally reader-friendly Website.
          <P>
          It's also crucial to include 'Net novices in your test group.  After all,
          many of your site's readers will be new to the Internet and 
          to the Web.  
          <P>


          <STRONG>Step 3: Provide some brief instructions</STRONG><P>

          Understand that your evaluators will naturally assume that 
          the problems they encounter in using your site are the result 
          of some fault on their part, rather than a flaw in the design 
          of the site itself.  It is therefore vitally important for you to 
          explain to your testers that you need them to make note of 
          <STRONG>any</STRONG> problems they encounter, 
          regardless of what they believe the underlying cause to be.
          <P>

          <STRONG>Step 4: Leave</STRONG><P>

          In formal usability experiments, the experimenter typically 
          remains in the room to observe and record testers' behavior. 
          But unless you're a trained usability professional, your 
          presence will likely as not serve to inhibit your evaluators, 
          and thus compromise their ability to test your site.  Unless 
          you're planning on providing a personally-supervised guided 
          tour of your site to  <STRONG>all</STRONG> your 
          readers, leave your tester to the business of testing your site.  
          Allow your tester sufficient time to test your site.  (What's 
          "sufficient" will obviously vary,  depending on the 
          content and nature of the site.  Allow at least 2-3 minutes 
          per page, but let your evaluator decide when the test is 
          finished.)
          <P>

          <H4>A Skeletal Checklist</H4>
          Obviously, there is no "one-size-fits-all" reader-friendliness 
          checklist that's universally applicable to all the Websites 
          in the world.  Still, you will get the best results from user 
          testing if you ask your testers to focus on a limited number 
          (6-10 is probably ideal) of fairly specific questions and criteria.  
          
          (Readers interested in learning more about basic guidelines 
          for creating friendly Web pages may want to check out 
          another article in this series, 
          <A HREF="35252.html">What Is "Reader-Friendly"?</A>)<P>

          Some suggested starting points for a reader-friendliness 
          checklist include:<P>
          <UL>

               <LI><STRONG>Clarity of Communication</STRONG><P>
               Does the site convey a clear sense of its intended audience?<P>
               Does it use language in a way that is familiar to and comfortable 
               for its readers?<P>
               Is it conversational in its tone?<P>

               <LI><STRONG>Accessibility</STRONG><P>
               Is load time appropriate to content, even on a slow 
               dial-in connection?<P>
               Is it accessible to readers with physical impairments?<P>
               Is there an easily discoverable means of communicating 
               with the author or administrator?<P>

               <LI><STRONG>Consistency</STRONG><P>
               Does the site have a consistent, clearly recognizable 
               "look-&amp;-feel"?<P>
               Does it make effective use of repeating visual themes to 
               unify the site?<P>
               Is it visually consistent even <EM>without</EM>
               graphics?<P>

               <LI><STRONG>Navigation</STRONG><P>
               Does the site use (approximately) standard link colors?<P>  
               Are the links obvious in their intent and destination?<P>
               Is there a convenient, obvious way to maneuver among 
               related pages, and between different sections?<P>

               <LI><STRONG>Design &amp; maintenance</STRONG><P>
               Does the site make effective use of hyperlinks to tie related 
               items together?<P>
               Are there dead links?  Broken CGI scripts?  Functionless 
               forms?<P>
               Is page length appropriate to site content?<P>

               <LI><STRONG>Visual Presentation</STRONG><P>
               Is the site moderate in its use of color?<P>
               Does it avoid juxtaposing text and animations?<P>
               Does it provide feedback whenever 
               possible?<P>
               (for example, through the 
               use of an easily recognizable <CODE>ALINK</CODE>
               color, or a "reply" screen for forms-based pages)
          </UL>
          <P>

          <H4>Obtaining Feedback</H4>
          A basic truism of usability testing is that <EM>there is 
          basically no such thing as a "user error."</EM>  For every 
          problem your testers identify, make sure you ask enough 
          clarifying questions to allow you to understand the nature 
          of the difficulties they encountered.  At all costs, however, 
          avoid the temptation to argue with your tester, or to 
          "explain away" the problems identified during testing. 
          If an evaluator found something confusing, then
          it's a safe bet that some percentage of your overall 
          readership finds it equally unclear.<P>

          <H4>The Ultimate User Test</H4>
          If you're ever lucky enough to have have the 
          chance, simply <STRONG>watch</STRONG> someone 
          navigate your site.  Don't prompt them, coach them, or 
          correct them.  Merely observe.  Even for seasoned 
          systems and usability professionals, it's a profoundly 
          humbling experience.
