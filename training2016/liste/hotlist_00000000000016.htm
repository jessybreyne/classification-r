		<p><b>Ariane 5, June 1996.</b> The maiden launch of the Ariane 5 rocket blew up 40 seconds from liftoff. The rocket and it's four satellites were uninsured and worth $500 million. The proximate cause of the crash was an overflow error due to an attempt to convert a 64 bit floating point value into a 16 bit integer. This error occurred in code that was non-functional after liftoff, when the error occurred. The <a href="http://www.esrin.esa.it/htdocs/tidc/Press/Press96/ariane5rep.html">Inquiry Board report</a> provides details regarding the software failure and the design policies that lead to it. A <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/18.24.html#subj2">note</a> in the Risks Digest indicates that a complete system test would have found the problem but was vetoed for budgetary reasons. </p>
		<p><b>Therac-25, June 1985 - January 1987.</b> The Therac-25 medical linear accelerator was responsible for six accidents involving massive overdoses of radiation, three of which lead to deaths. The proximate causes of the accidents were eventually attributed to two separate and hard-to-reproduce faults caused by race conditions in the data entry system. IEEE Computer published a <a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~cs3604/lib/Therac_25/Therac_1.html">summary report</a> by Nancy Leveson and Clark Turner. Nancy Leveson also published a <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/safety/www/papers/therac.ps">detailed account</a> as a chapter in her book <i>Safeware: System Safety and Computers</i>.</p>
		<p><b>Boris Beizer's List</b>. Boris Beizer has said, &quot;Remember that the most notorious bugs in the history of software development were all unit bugs -- bugs that would have been found by proper unit testing.&quot; (Letter to swtest-discuss, 10 June 1997). Here is his list: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Voyager bug (sent the probe into the sun). 
			<li>The AT&amp;T bug that took out 1/3 of US telephones. 
			<li>The DCS bug that took out the other 1/3 a few months later. 
			<li>The Intel Pentium chip bug (it was software, not hardware). 
			<li>The Ariane V bug. 
		</ol>
		<p>In a later letter, he agreed that the Therac 25 bug was also notorious, but not really a unit bug. </p>
		<p>John Shore <a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~sphampel/Fun/Computer/famous.bug.txt">collected</a> a number of reports, often apocryphal, of famous bugs. </p>

		<h3><a name="books"></a><font size="4">Recommended Books</font></h3>
		<p><i>I most frequently find myself recommending the following books to people who are new to software testing.</i> </p>
		<h4>Testing Computer Software, by Kaner, Falk &amp; Nguyen </h4>
		<p>If you read only one book on software testing, read this book. Many books will tell you how to test when you have enough time and cooperation. This book tells you what to do when the schedule is tight, the specification is missing, and the developers are tired of your focus on problems. It has sound advice and is a pleasure to read. I keep coming back to it. Feel like you have an impossible job? Read this book. </p>
