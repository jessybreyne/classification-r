<center><h2>Academic Job Application Checklist</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Mary Corbin Sies</b>, Department of American Studies, University of
Maryland, College Park
<p>
The following checklist was created to summarize steps in the
generic academic job application process for entry level American Studies
candidates from start to finish. Applying
for academic jobs requires a lot of preparation time--more than neophyte
applicants usually realize or have.  It is especially difficult to prepare
materials for applications and interviews when one is struggling to meet
deadlines for completing a dissertation.  This checklist is intended to
give you a sense, at a glance, of everything you MIGHT be asked to do or
to provide so that you can manage your time as well as possible.
<br><p>
You are welcome to link to or to reproduce this page so long as you
include the credit line above and do not alter the content.  I would be
interested in knowing how useful you find the checklist. If you send me
suggestions for amendments or revisions, I will cheerfully consider them
and change the page where appropriate.

<p>
CHECKLIST FOR JOB APPLICATION PROCESS
<p>
1. Update or establish a placement file with your university or
department placement office.  Begin this process in August.  Your
credentials file
should contain a curriculum vitae,
precis of dissertation, list of courses/comprehensive exams, letters of
recommendation, and 
summaries
of teaching evaluations.  Complete your credentials file in advance of the
first job
deadlines so that you are not compelled to do a fast or sloppy job of it.
Request that the
dossier be sent to search committees well in advance of deadlines.  
Some deadlines
may be as early as 9/30 and some placement offices are slow to send out.
It is
best to obtain updated letters of recommendation each year. 
<p>
2. Begin checking job ads from September on.  Regularly check these
sources as appropriate for your particular field of study:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>* Chronicle of Higher Education<br>
* MLA Jobletter<br>
* AHA Perspectives<br>
* ASA Newsletter<br>
* CAA Careers bulletin<br>
* SAH Newsletter<br>
* the appropriate job bulletin for your field<br>
* don't neglect online sources or equivalents of the bulletins above for
faster notice of new postings.</blockquote>
<p>

3. Keep your advisor(s) apprised of which jobs you're applying for--update
their list as 
needed--
in case they know someone in the departments to which you're applying or
get phonecalls from the search committees.
<p>
4. Do your homework: Research specific jobs in the college catalog
collection and through your
gossip networks.  Display this knowledge in your application materials.
<p>
5. Send out applications--being careful to meet the deadlines.  Send what
the search committee asks for; follow instructions, in other words.
Usually they will ask for the standard items in your credentials file: 
cover letter,
C.V., letters of recommendation (at least 3), dissertation precis 
or research summary.  Keep the precis short.  If the search committee
wants a full writing sample, they'll ask for it.  Sending tons of paper
before
it's requested may irritate some members of the committee.  Many colleges
or universities will require an original transcript sent directly from
your
university. <p>
6. Set up a system of information control so you can keep track of your 
progress
for each job.
<p>
7. Once the initial screening begins, you may be asked for additional
materials.  Send supporting documentation as requested.
This stage of the search usually begins in November and
continues through late January or a bit later.  These materials may
include<br><br>
<blockquote>* course syllabi or proposals<br>
* course evaluations<br>
* offprints or preprints of articles<br>
* all or part of your dissertation<br>
* statement of teaching philosophy</blockquote>
<p>
8. Plan to attend the major conventions in your field.  If you are really
serious about getting a job, you need to attend these annual meetings to
engage in the networking, scholarly exchange, and schmoozing of
publishers' representatives that is necessary for career advancement.  In
American Studies, these meetings might include<br><br>
<blockquote>* American Studies Association in late October or November<br>
* American Historical Association or Modern Language Association in late
December or early January<br>
* College Art Association in February<br>
* Others as appropriate to your field</blockquote>
<p>
9. Prepare for convention interviews.
Undertake additional research on the department, including research and
teaching 
interests
of faculty members.  
Prepare good raps on your dissertation research, future research plans,
how 
you'd
teach courses you know they need taught, and what else you'd like to
teach. Have a good set of questions to ask them that demonstrates that
you've done your homework about their department, institution, and
location.
<p>  
IMPORTANT: If you are interviewing in the dreaded
"job pit" at one of the big annual meetings, be sure to familiarize
yourself with that scene before you interview.  There's nothing quite like
the contagious panic and nervousness that pervades a gigantic room with 50
tables and 50 simultaneous interviews going on and no privacy.
<p>
10. Prepare for campus interviews.  These "flybacks" may occur as early as
December but usually take place between January and March.
Have a 45 min. presentation on your research ready to go.
Rehearse it.  For more information on the kinds of questions you might be
asked, see my <a
href="http://otal.umd.edu/~sies/jobquess.html">Academic Job Interview
Questions</a>.
<p>
11. Wait to hear the search results.  Search committees follow their own
timelines in these matters.  You may receive an offer within a day or two
of your campus visit or 4-6 weeks later.  You may receive a rejection call
or letter within a week of your visit, several weeks later, or never.
<p>
Some additional advice on managing your time in the job application
process:
<p>
<blockquote>* Be generous in calculating the amount of time you need to
manage this
process well.
<p>
* Know what you have to do and prepare in advance.  It is terribly
difficult to invent a syllabus for a new course or write an impressive job
talk when your interview is a week away.
<p>
* Keep good records so you know where you stand w/each position.
<p>
* Keep in touch with your gossip network and work it for all it's worth.
<p>
* (I'm sorry to say this, but) 
Plan to lose three months on your dissertation: Nov. through Jan or
whenever
the interviewing ends.</blockquote>
<p><br>
What should you include on your c.v.? The
most important points to summarize quickly are
<p>
<blockquote>* institutions granting degree<br>
* research and teaching fields<br>
* publications<br>
* teaching experience and list of courses you've taught<br>
* academic awards and grants <br>
* references w/phone numbers and full addresses<br></blockquote>
<p>
Other items to consider including: 
<p>
<blockquote>* evidence of
additional talents as appropriate for the job<br>
* conference papers<br>
* book reviews<br>
* service or administrative experience<br>
* professional memberships and offices held</blockquote>
<p>
What not to include: <p>
<blockquote>* business experience unless it relates directly to academe or
to the
specific qualities asked for in the position announcement<br>
* detailed personal information </blockquote><br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: Use your wordprocessor to tailor the c.v. to the specific job.
<p>
What to put in a cover letter:
<p>
<blockquote>* mention where you saw the job posted<br>
* your basic fields (tailor appropriately)<br>
* a summary of your past research<br>
* a summary of your future research<br>
* teaching experience and interests<br>
* what you can do for this particular department</blockquote>
<p>
IMPORTANT: The purpose of the cover letter and application is to obtain 
an interview.  So ASK for an interview; indicate whether you'll be
attending the usual conventions.
<p>
ALSO IMPORTANT: You should emphasize certain parts of your credentials and
talents for certain jobs.  Graduate degree-granting institutions will be
more interested in research than teaching.  Most other institutions will
be primarily interested in your teaching experience and approaches.
<p>
Good Luck!
