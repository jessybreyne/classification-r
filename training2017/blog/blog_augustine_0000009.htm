<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99"> LIGHT BLOGGING AND SLOW LOADING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">My sister is visiting from Paris 
  this week so we'll be out and about, hither and thither, in and out. So the 
  blogging must take a back seat. Down Blog, down. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Btw, is anyone else finding that 
  my blog loads very very slooowly? My friend <a href="http://cancergiggles.blog-city.com/" target="_blank">Cass</a> 
  tells me that I'm the slowest load of all the many blogs he visits. Are you 
  all being too polite to tell me? It loads fast for me on IE 5 and also on Opera, 
  and I have broadband. So I have no way of knowing what other people see or don't 
  see. Please speak up if you have problems. Any problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99">ARE WE BEING STALKED?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Of course we are. The internet 
  is stalkers' paradise and every bit of information, from the size of our member 
  to the size of our bank balance is being avidly collected by someone somewhere 
  for who knows what sinister or commercial or trivial or crazy purpose.<br>
  <br>
  I'm fully aware of this so I shouldn't have been gob-smacked when, innocently 
  clicking on a <a href="http://danzcontrib.free.fr/en/index.php" target="_blank">link</a><font color="#FFFFFF">*</font> 
  found via Google (searching for &quot;blocked referrer&quot;) I was instantly 
  confronted with a page headed: <font color="#FFFFFF">COLLECTED DATA ABOUT YOU</font>, 
  followed by, yes, data about me. Or rather about my website: my IP number, location, 
  host, browser, my last 20 visitors on June 01 (with their IP and hosts), a list 
  of countries who have visited me and the number of my visitors from April 20, 
  2003 to June 01, 2004 (35332). Actually that figure is wrong, my own stats show 
  119,572. But never mind the inaccuracy, feel the spying! <br>
  <font color="#FFFFFF">*<i><font size="1">It wasn't the site's home page that 
  opened when I first clicked on it but their page with information about my site.</font></i></font><br>
  Who gave them the right to snoop my site, as well as - and this is more disturbing 
  - posting detailed instructions telling everyone how they too can break into 
  any website?<br>
  <br>
  Of course I'm interested to see my stats but do I want the whole world's hackers 
  and nutters to have the keys to my cyber home? No I do not and I left a message 
  to that effect, asking the site's owner to explain what he's up to. It's a French 
  website, his name is Dan and I'll report back later when/if I get an answer. 
  Meanwhile, en garde!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99">UPDATE ON THE ABOVE<br>
  <font color="#99CCFF"> I must now apologise to Dan, webmaster of the <a href="http://danzcontrib.free.fr/en/index.php" target="_blank">above 
  site</a>, for presuming that his methods were in any way dishonourable. He has 
  written to me courteously and in great detail, explaining technical points about 
  the way his site works. We have exchanged messages in our native language (French) 
  but my techie knowledge is limited and I still find some aspects of this data-gathering 
  disturbing. Judge for yourselves by visiting his site. For the sake of fairness, 
  here is a short extract from one of the letters I received from Dan today:<font color="#CCCCCC"> 
  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CCCCCC"><i>&quot;My site is written in 
  PHP, that's the page where you should have landed. That means that each time 
  someone connects to the site, the html page is generated and is UNIQUE. It's 
  normal that you get the same information when you connect as you are unique, 
  except for your IP which is dynamically allocated, I suppose, and your browser 
  which you can change if you want. Each time you load or reload a page, it is 
  completely new and somene else, being somewhere else will get a different page.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Changing the subject entirely, 
  the next God interview is nearly ready to go to press, Another day or two should 
  do it.</font></p>
