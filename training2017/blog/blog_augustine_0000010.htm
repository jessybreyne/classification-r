<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><a href="http://terencemendoza.co.uk/"><img src="blogimages/fundus.jpg" width="200" height="184" align="left" name="fundus.jpg" border="1" alt="Fundus Oculi"></a>All 
  the comments I got on this subject were interesting but the closest to a solution 
  was from Fred of <a href="http://fragmentsfromfloyd.com" target="_blank"> fragments 
  from floyd</a> who mentioned the <font color="#FFCC99"><i>fundus</i><font color="#99CCFF">. 
  I searched Google and discovered optometrist </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><a href="http://www.terencemendoza.co.uk" target="_blank">Terry 
  Mendoza's</a> </font><font color="#99CCFF"> very informative site about sight 
  and sent him an e-mail with my query. I got a prompt and helpful reply, part 
  of which I quote below, for the benefit of anyone else who has a tiny cinema 
  behind their eyelids.<br>
  But first, examine this picture of the <font color="#FFCC99">Fundus Oculi</font> 
  (<font size="1"><i>image courtesy M.N. Watts, The City University) </i><font size="2"> 
  and then look again at my drawing of the whirly thingy. Not a bad match between 
  the blood vessels and my diagram, eh? Here's Terry Mendoza speaking:</font></font></font></font></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99">&quot;The phenomenon you 
    describe is one of a family of such 'visions' termed entoptic phenomena. The 
    first thing I should caution is that pressing on the eyeball is not a good 
    thing to do as if there is a fragile area of retina this could be sufficient 
    to start a retinal tear (detachment). Stimulation of the retina gives rise 
    to electrical signals being sent to the brain which are interpreted as light, 
    or arrangements of light. Usually the retina is stimulated by light falling 
    on its photoreceptors, but in the phenomenon you describe, the pressure on 
    the eyeball is distorting the underlying retina. This stretching of the retina 
    is what gives rise to simple patterns of light.&quot;</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Terry also gave me two great 
  links: <a href="http://www.ravenfamily.org/ffetch/comments/entoptic.php" target="_blank">Visual 
  Basic </a>and <a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/avenue/pd49/pockets/weird/entoptic/entop/entoptic.htm" target="_blank">Entoptic 
  Images</a> which describe the phenomenon and relate it, as some of the commenters 
  here did, to hallucinogenic and other types of visions and archetypal patterns. 
  This is all fascinating and I will look into it further but part of my mystery 
  is still not solved: the </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">examples 
  illustrated and described do not ressemble those images I've seen which are 
  not patterns, but realistic faces, figures, etc. A recent one - I know nobody 
  will believe this but I swear I didn't invent it- was a small yellow rectangle 
  with ragged edges, in the middle of which was handwritten the word &quot;you&quot;. 
  How could this be produced by a stretching of the retina? I accept the entoptic 
  explanation but there's got to be more to it. One thing occurs to me: <font color="#FFCC99"><i>&quot;</i></font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99">Stimulation 
  of the retina gives rise to electrical signals being sent to the brain</font></i><font color="#FFCC99"><i>&quot;</i></font> 
  - could it also work the other way round? Signals from the brain being sent 
  to the retina? I will stop here and go to sleep and see if dreams provide any 
  new information. Many thanks to Terry Mendoza and to all of you for your input.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I am number <s>42</s> (yesterday) 
  44 (today) on a <a href="http://www.troubleddiva.com/mostlinkedukblogs.htm" target="_blank">list</a> 
  compiled by <a href="http://www.troubleddiva.com/" target="_blank">Troubled 
  Diva</a> of the most linked UK weblogs and I know it's completely meaningless 
  but nevertheless gives me a small glow of satisfaction that a one-year old cartoon 
  is on such a list at all. The fact that <a href="http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Belle 
  de Jour</a> is currently No.1 has woken my dormant competitive instinct and 
  I'd be really chuffed to knock her/him off that pedestal. Everybody but me has 
  had something to say about BdJ and it's time I added my rant to this irrelevant 
  bloggossip. <br>
  <br>
  Whoever the real BdJ is, that blog's DNA can be found in <a href="http://magazines.ivillage.com/cosmopolitan" target="_blank">Cosmopolitan</a><i> 
  </i>and other <i>How To Treat Men As Sex Objects As Well As Being Feminine</i>

  while at the same time wearing <i>designer wardrobes</i> and giving/receiving<i> 
  blowjobs</i> and hunting for the <i>Perfect Designer Soulmate</i>...hey, wow, 
  are we <i>empowered </i>or what? That's where Belle de Jour is coming from, 
  to coin another clich&eacute;, and the literary pretension is yet another layer 
  of gloss on the nail polish. Her Call Girl Life is <a href="http://www.movieforum.com/movies/titles/prettywoman/review.shtml" target="_blank">Pretty 
  Woman</a> Hollywood-style designer label antiseptic prostitution and yes, the 
  style sells like hotcakes. So what? Any woman who's had.....(<font size="1">fill 
  in the number</font>) <s>lovers</s> sex partners could tell you more observant, 
  funnier, sadder, sleazier, sexier, less self-centered tales. (No, I'm not going 
  to do it). As for prostitution as lifestyle, maybe all the girls from Eastern 
  Europe who are being er, recruited, into that career could be persuaded to blog 
  about it? From the trenches, as it were. </font></p>

  was going to lay off politics for a while but this isn't politics, it's sheer 
  exhilaration that <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/" target="_blank">Michael 
  Moore</a> won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for <i><font color="#FFCC99">Fahrenheit 
  9/11</font></i>. When it gets American distribution, and it surely will, watch 
  the sparks fly. Here's a quote from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34917-2004May17?language=printer" target="_blank">Washington 
  Post</a>:<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CCCCFF"><i>What's remarkable here isn't 
  Moore's political animosity or ticklish wit. It's the well-argued, heartfelt 
  power of his persuasion. Even though there are many things here that we have 
  already learned, Moore puts it all together. It's a look back that feels like 
  a new gaze forward. The movie points to social and financial connections between 
  the Bush family and wealthy Saudis, including the royal family, Prince Bandar 
  (the Saudi ambassador to Washington) and the bin Laden family. It shows startling 
  footage taken by camera crews who were embedded with the American forces in 
  Iraq. And it spends time with such people as Lila Lipscomb, a Michigan mother 
  who changes from patriotic support for the Bush administration to heartbroken 
  despair after she loses a son to the war. There are so many powerful moments 
  to point to, all for different reasons: the visceral terror of a household in 
  Baghdad, as young American soldiers break in to arrest someone; the candid testimony 
  of American soldiers who express their disgust at the situation there; interviews 
  in Michigan with impoverished African Americans, a social group that has been 
  a breadbasket for U.S. Army recruitment. To watch this movie yourself is to 
  realize with dawning appreciation that the director of "Bowling for Columbine" 
  has finally learned to put his movie where his mouth is.</i></font></p>

  his professional techpertise to finding the specific sequence of arcane words

  And don't miss <a href="http://www.guildofghostwriters.com/" target="_blank">Dem's</a>

  an addict, a blogging addict. I dream at night of things I have blogged, should 
  blog or did not blog. I ruminate on comments that have been made or have not 
  been made on my blog or that I might make or will make in other blogs. I check 
  my stats more than once a day. More than twice a day. Allright, I check my stats 
  a lot. I also check my Technorati rati quite a lot. I read the newspapers and 
  feel guilty that I am not blogging about the news because nobody will know what's 
  going on in the world if I don't blog about it. It's my duty to blog about all 
  the injustice and lies and horror because if people don't read it in my blog 
  then they won't know it's happening. It's also my duty to blog about the meaning 
  of life and everything because if it's not in my blog then where are people 
  going to find out? It's also my duty to translate my every passing thought and 
  observation and experience into bloggish because if I don't then, well, then 
  I'm not a good and frequent blogger and nobody will visit me. I get withdrawal 
  symptoms if I am away from my screen for more than a day even when I'm not blogging

  guiding principle in world affairs and in our lives.<br>
  <br>
  This morning, unbidden, a few words from a long-forgotten song by the genius 
  singer/songwriter <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/brel_jacques/bio.jhtml" target="_blank">Jacques 
  Brel</a> popped into my head. I googled and found the <a href="http://www.members.tripod.com/%7EBrel/lairdela_betise.html" target="_blank">complete 
  lyrics</a> to <font color="#FFCC99"><i>&quot;L'Air de la B&ecirc;tise&quot;</i></font> 
  (&quot;Stupidity's Song&quot;) and I've rough-translated part of it below because 
  it is so relevant. The official site for Jacques Brel is <a href="http://www.jacquesbrel.be/index03UK.htm" target="_blank">here</a> 
  , there are pictures <a href="http://www.members.tripod.com/%7EBrel/brel.html" target="_blank">here</a> 
  and if any of you have never heard Brel sing, I suggest that you beg, borrow, 
  buy or download his entire repertoire because nearly all his songs are masterpieces 
  and that's no exaggeration. Btw, he didn't sing in English - it's worth learning

  concubine liked them so much that he had relays of horses carrying them for 
  hundreds of miles to satisfy her craving. I wouldn't mind a repeat of that performance 
  for my delectation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Watching this wonderful creature

  its glory - a bit of soil, light and water, that's it. So many people on earth 
  strive and struggle and despair their lives away yet we could all be at peace 
  with only a bit of soil, water, and light...outer and inner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Last night was the night 40 or 
  50 bloggers met - or didn't meet - in the basement of the International Bar 
  off Trafalgar Square. The walls were Inferno Red, lighting minimal, noise maximal 
  and food almost gone by the time I arrived at 8:30. I was delayed because at 
  the last minute I decided to make a Blaugustine badge: printed blue lettering 
  on a red background stuck to an old &quot;<i>I am nearly famous</i>&quot; badge. 
  This turned out to be entirely invisible in the red mist. But stickers had been 
  thoughtfully provided on which bloggers wrote their names or aliases. Unfortunately 
  I couldn't read them because people, on the whole, are much taller than I am 
  and it's silly to stand on tiptoe to read their lapels.<br>

  The truth is that I am not a great live (as in&quot;non-virtual&quot;) networker. 
  To be a successful Live Networker you must have at least two of the following: 
  height, hutzpah, charisma, a good memory, lots of acquaintances, a bottomless 
  supply of small talk, and a mastery of the art of selling yourself without appearing 
  to do so. Fame, gorgeousness and genius are also a big help in working a room. 
  Now, I may have one of these qualities but certainly not two. So I prefer to 
  do my networking hidden behind my computer screen.<br>

  the same, I was glad to meet two people I knew only from their blogs: the idiosyncratically 
  insightful and innovative <a href="http://ming.tv/" target="_blank">Ming </a>(Flemming 
  Funch) and the delightfully informative <a href="http://london-underground.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Annie 
  Mole</a>, whose blog makes even London Underground's miseries seem fun. I had 
  brief shouting conversations with both of them and I'm not sure what any of 
  us said but it was nice to see them in the real world anyway. I shouted with 
  three or four other friendly bloggers and will look up their sites when I can 
  find the cards they gave me. I'm sorry for not listing more names but it's all 
  a bit blurred, not due to alcohol consumption - I only had two beers and was 
  home in time to catch Newsnight.<br>

  camera flashes were pointed in my direction a few times and I want to warn you 
  that if you should happen to see photos anywhere on the net purporting to be 
  of me<i> DO NOT BELIEVE THEM! <br>
  </i>It's bad enough being trapped behind the remarkably unphotogenic countenance 
  of Natalie without having to endure the ordeal of mistaken identity. I demanded 
  that N provide a snapshot of herself taken in the mirror this morning so as 
  to prove that she stayed home and was not with me last night. She was only half 
  awake when this was shot which accounts for the half-closed eyelids. Behind 
  her is the same half-finished painting which appeared in a previous photo of 
  her studio. The best thing in this photo is the reflection around the edges 
  of the mirror.</font></p>

  GOODNESS? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> The latest horror news: a video 
  of the revenge beheading of a kidnapped American civilian. (See <a href="http://www.notfrisco2.com/webzine/Joel/" target="_blank">Joel's</a> 
  eloquent post on <font color="#FFCC99"><i>The Death of Nick Berg</i></font>). 
  We know that horror begets horror, violence begets violence and terror begets 
  more terror but, oblivious to the chain of cause and effect, self-righteous 
  voices are now screaming: &quot;Barbarians!&quot;<br>
  Yes, such actions are barbaric. Yes they are monstrous. Yes they are evil. But 
  let all those who are screaming:&quot;Barbarians!&quot; look inside their own 
  hearts and minds and let he who is incapable of barbarism cast the first stone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Whenever evil acts are discovered 
  to have been perpetrated by people perceived as Good, there is an assumption 
  that the offenders were either ordered by their superiors to perform such acts, 
  or led astray by bad companions, or that they believed their actions served 
  a higher purpose.<br>
  When evil acts are perpetrated by those perceived to be intrinsically evil, 
  their actions are not speculated about: they are Evil, and that's that. <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">In the first instance, 
  the culprits are seen as essentially good but capable of committing wrong actions 
  under certain circumstances.<br>
  In the second case, the culprits are seen as essentially bad and acting in evil 
  ways because that's what they do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Isn't there a third way?<br>
  <br>
  Since it has been proved that human beings can be conditioned to perform evil, 
  can it not also be proved that they can be conditioned to do good, and to refuse 
  to do evil?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">At 1:20 AM last Saturday (May 
  8) on Channel 4 here in London there was a very interesting and frightening 
  documentary called <a href="http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/S/science/society/killing.html" target="_blank">&quot;The 
  Truth About Killing&quot;</a>. One of the things which most impressed and appalled 
  me was the army training camp somewhere in America where the mayhem of war and 
  violence is super-realistically simulated in order to de-sensitize soldiers 
  to the horrors of the real thing. <br>
  <br>
  It made me think:<br>
  Why couldn't camps be created where situations of conflict are likewise realistically 
  simulated but people are trained to go in and resolve them by peaceful and rational 
  means? And where they learn to reject being coerced into acting in evil ways, 
  under any circumstances.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I know that non-violence training 
  has existed for a long time and that peace-making and conflict resolution groups 
  are active in many places. Could they all come together in a global effort to 
  set up </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> training centres 
  in every country, every town and village on the planet? Centres where the good 
  in human nature is held up as our strength rather than our weakness. Where the 
  good is nurtured, challenged, brought face to face with situations in which 
  it must confront evil with goodness, rather than with evil. Is this an impossible 
  dream? </font></p>

  Natalie was commissioned last year to design and build a website for an artist 
  friend, Yaron Livay. It has taken her far too long and, frankly, I was getting 
  a bit fed up with all the fussing and fiddling with this work and the neglecting 
  of me. So I put my foot down and said that if she didn't finish the job in the 
  next few days, I would simply walk out. That pulled her up sharpish and lo and 
  behold, a series of sleepless nights have done the trick and the website for 
  Yaron, brilliant artist printmaker, is finally ready.<br>
  <br>
  I have given N permission to preview it on our site so that we can see how it 
  looks and if it works. It can then be transferred to another hosting server 
  and start its own life in cyberspace. <br>
  <br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Didn't Bush and Blair and their 
  supporters say words like these not long ago in their impassioned defense of 
  their War on Terror? Didn't they say that we are the good guys, the civilized, 
  the ones who uphold moral values - decency, democracy, humanity and all those 
  other fine and righteous things? Didn't they also say, and doesn't some of the 
  media often repeat, that the bad guys are uncivilized barbarians?<br>

  This page will not be fouled with the dirty pictures of American military personnel 
  abusing Iraqi prisoners but if anyone has yet to see them they are <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0430-01.htm" target="_blank">here 
  </a> and here is a full <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040510fa_fact" target="_blank">report</a> 
  in the New Yorker. David Hoffman - always sane, balanced and compassionate - 
  has further links at <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ehumanitycheck" target="_blank">Humanity 
  Check </a> . What is even more shocking than the actions of those particular 
  male and female soldiers who were sent to Iraq to 'fight for civilization' are 
  the inane, obscene grins on their faces, grins that say &quot;Hey, we're just 
  having some fun!&quot; In defense of their actions it has been claimed that 
  they did not receive proper training on how to deal with prisoners. <i>Proper 
  training</i>?? And these are adults, brought up in the land of the free, the 
  brave, the good and the civilized. Are they saying that, without proper training, 
  everyone would have done the same in those circumstances?<br>
  <br>
  In<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1207458,00.html" target="_blank"> 
  today's Guardian</a> there are reports that British troops in Iraq have also 
  been involved in torture of prisoners and detainees. Of course not all American, 
  British or other coalition soldiers behave this way and it is because of the 
  conscience and courage of some that such despicable actions come to light. Eventually, 
  maybe it will be recognized that those individuals who dare to blow the whistle 
  and who refuse to participate in anti-human actions are the real heroes, the 
  truly civilized.<br>
