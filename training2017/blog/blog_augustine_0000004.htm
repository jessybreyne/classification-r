<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><img src="blogimages/mykitchen.jpg" width="350" height="436" align="left" name="mykitchen.jpg" alt="My kitchen">I 
  had every intention of doing the <a href="http://www.sketchcrawl.com/" target="_blank">Sketchcrawl</a> 
  yesterday all day, covering dozens of sheets of paper with beautiful impressions 
  of everything in sight, especially London sights, since I'm the only one (?) 
  in London to have signed up for this drawing marathon. However, the best laid 
  plans of mice end up with cheese in mousetraps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> I got up late, tired and achy 
  from having been frozen the day before and decided to do my first sketch from 
  a hot bath. Took pen and watercolours and got into the pine green Radoxified 
  tub. It was going pretty well when the fingers of my right hand holding the 
  brush went numb. And number. Rubbing and shaking the hand did not help so I 
  got out of the bath and went to get the camera. Held it carefully above the 
  suds and tried to shoot the picture of my foot under water and the taps with 
  shower coiled around them. The camera would not work. Batteries probably dead. 
  Abandoned the bathtub plan. Ate breakfast (afternoon of a grey rainy cold day 
  getting darker by the minute). Looked out the window and rejected idea of drawing 
  the buildings across the street. I don't really like drawing buildings, too 
  many windows and fiddly bits. Decided to sketch the kitchen because of the nice 
  black diamond pattern on the floor. This took far longer than I wanted to spend 
  on it and when it was done I was not well pleased. An efficient but boring drawing, 
  revealing my lack of enthusiasm for the subject. By that time night had fallen 
  and the day was kaputt. So I decided to cheat and present my one sketch as if 
  I had done more than one. I might crawl back into the tub now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I don't know many Baptist preachers 
  - allright I don't know any Baptist preachers - and I don't know much about 
  Baptists in general. But I do know this: if I lived in East Texas I would go 
  and find the little church where <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001772/" target="_blank">Real 
  Live Preacher</a> (aka Gordon Atkinson) preaches and I would join his congregation. 
  I would take off my <i>I'm a Christian but of course not a conventional one</i> 
  pretentions like an old coat and I'd sit down and eat humble pie with Gordon 
  and his little flock. Why? Because this man is the real McCoy. He sounds and 
  acts like an American version of what it must have been like to be an early 
  Christian, a very early Christian, before the rot started eating away at the 
  foundations built by God's chosen carpenter. It doesn't mean that RLP is a guru 
  or miracle worker or anything of the sort. This is his self-description:<br>
  <br>
  </font><i><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">I'm just a guy with 
  a bad haircut bouncing a ball around the sanctuary and talking to himself.</font></i></p>

  on p.118 of his new book <i><font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001772/book.html" target="_blank">RealLivePreacher.com</a></font></i> 
  which I bought recently. Some of his true-life stories are sweet and tender 
  but when he really hits home for me is when he is alone talking to himself or 
  lashing out passionately at hypocrisy, arrogance, falsity and materialism. Here 
  is an extract from the chapter <i><font color="#CCCCCC">I have no title for 
  this</font></i>. Read the whole book - whether you are a believer, unbeliever 
  or anything in between, this real live preacher will move you.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Sit down, Christian. Sit down 
  and be you silent.<br>
  </font></i><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Verdana" size="2"><i>How long has it 
  been since you forgot that we were called to walk on earth as pilgrims? Do you 
  not remember when he told us to give our coats to those in need and sell our 
  possessions to help the poor? Did you forget how the first church had all things 
  in common so that none would lack? Did you forget the day he told us that whatever 
  we did for the oppressed we did for him, and whatever we withheld from them 
  was kept from him as well?<br>
  Sit down, Christian. You have not earned the right to speak to this generation. 
  The right to speak is earned with love.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I've gone and done it. Booked 
  a trip to Luxor. Last night, all fired up with rekindled Egyptomania I googled 
  for a cheap flight/hotel deal and found one: January 5th, seven nights in Luxor. 
  I'll start the new year on my old home ground. That's not me below, btw. It's 
  an ancient Egyptian thinking of a future life in London, 2004.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> When I say <i>me</i> in this 
  instance I mean <i>we</i>, me and Natalie and....allright, this is going to 
  stretch your credibility. So what's wrong with a credibility stretch? Dyed-in-the-wool 
  scientists can now leave the room, followed by dyed-in-the-wool New Agers, crystal 
  gazers and practitioners of past life regression. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> In my early teens I was back 
  in Paris after spending most of my childhood in South America and the USA. One 
  day I walked into the <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/anglais/collec/ae/ae_oeuv.htm" target="_blank">Egyptian 
  Antiquities</a> rooms in the Louvre for the first time. I don't remember if 
  anyone was with me, all I know is that I felt at home. Everything I saw was 
  d&eacute;ja vu even though I had never before been aware of ancient Egypt. The 
  thrill I felt was not exactly an aesthetic one. I wasn't responding to the artistry 
  of these statues, objects and inscriptions. I just <i>knew them.</i>They were 
  part of me. I had been there, done that. I knew with absolute certainty that 
  I had lived before in that time and place. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Then I discovered <font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.touregypt.net/historicalessays/hatshepsut.htm" target="_blank">Hatshepsut</a></font>. 
  Yes yes I know - everybody who gets hooked on reincarnation remembers they were 
  some big celebrity. There are probably hundreds of people who believe they were 
  Hatshepsut in their past lives. <font color="#FFCC99"><a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/tina_turner/bio.jhtml" target="_blank">Tina 
  Turner</a></font> for one. I read that she is sure as sure can be that she was 
  Hatshepsut because a psychic told her so.Well I'm not going to fight her for 
  the title. I like Tina Turner a lot. Maybe she was my daughter or my mother. 
  But I was Hatshepsut. Natalie and me were Hatshepsut and that's that.</font></p>

  </i><font color="#99CCFF">(geddit? Nat, not Hat, Shepsut)</font><i> </i><font color="#99CCFF">is 
  the title of an artwork that I made in 1992. Inside a &quot;sarcophagus&quot; 
  (made from a drawer) painted with Egyptian symbols lies a kind of book with 
  wood covers. It is wrapped in a linen cloth stained to look ancient. On one 
  side of the cloth are transfers of photos and newspaper cuttings and on the 
  reverse I wrote this poem: </font></font></p>
<blockquote>

    that she would live again<br>
    or whether I believe<br>
    that I have lived before<br>
    makes no difference to the truth<br>
    whatever it may be<br>
    but the spaces and the places<br>
    where I have lived<br>
    in my mind<br>
    and in my life<br>
    are joined in time<br>
    by some strange<br>
    symmetry. </i></font></p>

  August 1992 an exhibition of many of my bookworks was held at the <font color="#FFCC99">Rijksmuseum

  </font><font color="#99CCFF">I arrived to install the work, the Director saw 
  <i><font color="#FFCC99">Natshepsut</font></i> and asked if I knew that the 
  Museum had in its collection the only known remaining <i><a href="http://www.akhet.co.uk/shabti.htm" target="_blank">shabti</a></i> 
  (servant statuettes placed in tombs) of Hatshepsut. Of course I did not know 
  and you could have knocked me over with a feather. I asked to see the small 
  relic and the Director brought it down. And then he gave permission for it to 
  be shown in the glass case alongside <i><font color="#FFCC99">Natshepsut</font></i>. 
  There it is, our <i>shabti,</i> lying on its little black velvet cushion, reunited 
  with its owner. I took this poor snapshot at the exhibition, hampered by the 
  reflections in the glass and a lousy camera.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Returning to the Egyptian rooms 
  in the Louvre reminded me of all this. But I'm not interested in theories of 
  reincarnation or stories of past lives nor would I join any of those &quot;Mysteries 
  of Ancient Egypt&quot; crazy cults. So what's the point of this certainty about 
  a past life? I don't know. I just know I was there. But I'm here now and here 
  is where I want to be. One day I'll go and visit present day<a href="http://www.luxorguide.com/" target="_blank"> 
  Luxor</a> and take some pictures and do some drawings of my old old old old 
  stamping ground. But you can't go home again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFCC99">MON PARIS </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> Wander through all my <a href="paris.html">Paris 
  photos </a>and then come back here to comment. What can be said about Paris 
  that hasn't already been said? Everyone associates four things with my birthplace: 
  food, sex, art and the guillotine. Let me give you my angle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> <img src="photos/paris-oct04/patisserie.jpg" width="462" height="300" name="patisserie.jpg" alt="Paris pastries" border="1"><br>
  <br>
  1. <font color="#FFCC99">Food</font>: yesss! There is nothing in Parisian displays 
  of food that I don't want to eat immediately and in large quantities, even foods 
  I don't eat and don't like. The street markets redolent of colour, scent, taste, 
  touch. The boulangeries and patisseries which are what God created wheat for. 
  The restaurants - overpriced and not-like-the-good-old-days though they may 
  be, I still want to sit in every single one I pass and order everything on the 
  menu, every day, all day. I don't of course but I wish. The caf&eacute;s - I 
  want to be sitting in each and every one of them simultaneously, drinking red 
  wine and hot grog and cognac and pernod and coffee, coffee, coffee, talking 
  of Michelangelo (no no, not him) with Picasso and Apollinaire and Braque and 
  Matisse and Piaf and Aznavour and Greco and Brel and Brassens and Ferr&eacute; 
  and - well, you get my drift. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"><img src="photos/paris-oct04/sexx.jpg" width="419" height="325" border="1" name="sexx.jpg" alt="Espace X"><br>
  <br>
  2.<font color="#FFCC99"> Sex</font>: h'm. One can only speak from experience 
  but as I am not about to engage in intimate revelations, I will only say that 
  my Parisexe has not been the Paris of Henry Miller. Non, more like, miserable 
  (but not Les Mis&egrave;rables). French women's sexy reputation? I agree that 
  they look great, dress well and have a certain smile. However, imho, they lack 
  the je ne sais quoi, especially if they are TV presenters, executives and such. 
  The make-up is too made up, the demeanor too....what's the word? Contrived? 
  Humourless? I'm generalising but I don't think the French, in general, are sexy. 
  So there.</font></p>

  <i><font size="1" color="#CCCCCC">inverted glass pyramid in the Louvre's entrance 
  hall .</font></i><br>
  <br>
  3.<font color="#FFCC99"> Art</font>: yes indeed! Art is sexy and essential in 
  Paris, like the food. Sensual, tactile, handmade, necessary. I'm not talking 
  about any particular artists or styles or periods of art. Just art as an activity 
  and a product. Some small galleries around the rue de Seine give me the same 
  kind of frisson that I get in front of a boulangerie, as do the ateliers where 
  etchings are hand-printed or sculpture is made or tapestries woven or paintings 
  painted. And of course the museums, though the crowds and the entrance fees 
  have made them a less enjoyable experience.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">You 
  get the sense in Paris that to be an artist matters. It's not a substitute for 
  real job or an optional extra. It really really matters in the grand scheme 
  of things. I feel that I'm an artist when I'm in Paris.<br>
  <font color="#CCCCCC" size="1"><i> </i></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">4. <font color="#FFCC99">The

  decorated mirror in the same caf&eacute; where I shot the red-shirted waiter. 
  Maybe it illustrates La Revolution?<br>

  a riddle? I'd be surprised if anyone doesn't know that fl is also qb whose long-established, 
  inimitable blog is a joy for the mind, body (especially eyes) and soul. In real 
  life, we got on like a house on fire - I've never understood that expression 
  but it seems apt for spontaneous companionable combustion. qb is one of those 
  rare people in whose presence you feel appreciated, grateful to be yourself, 
  while wholly absorbed in discovering the other. With her uniquely frizzical 
  vision, she sees things that most people pass by and in my crowded attic studio, 
  she instantly saw the beauty hiding in the gears of my old etching press. Go 
  immediately to view the <a href="http://www.frizzylogic.org/" target="_blank">stunning 
  result</a> and, er, I'm there too. I promised to respect her anonymity so no 
  photo but here's a tribute to my new friend, an interpretation rather than an 
  accurate portrait. I made you more frizzy than you really are, qb, I hope you 
  don't mind.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF">I'm back, appalled at the election 
  result. A victory for fear, deceit and ignorance, the message preached from 
  Bush's pulpit. Kerry wasn't strong enough to counter it. But there is something 
  to be glad about - the huge number of people who turned up to vote for change, 
  their depth of feeling and committment. Those feelings won't go away and it's 
  quite possible that a tide of change will rise from the deep still waters and 
  not from posturing prancing preening gun-totin' Bible-thumpin' cowboys taking 
  the name of God as a vain excuse to commit whatever crimes they declare to be 
  their God-given right to commit. </font></p>
