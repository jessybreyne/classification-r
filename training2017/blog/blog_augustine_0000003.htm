  BEING</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#99CCFF"> <img src="blogimages/bigwave.jpg" width="375" height="250" name="bigwave.jpg" align="left"><font color="#000033">How 
  fragile we are as individuals and as the human race doesn't really register 
  in our consciousness unless we fall ill, or someone close to us dies or a mind-boggling 
  disaster occurs where thousands of lives are lost in an instant (currently about 
  60,000 are estimated to have been wiped out by the tsunami). It's then that 
  the penny drops: our physical presence here on this planet is as fragile as 
  a house on stilts in a tidal wave. Those of us privileged to live in the &quot;developed&quot; 
  areas of the world are cocooned into losing sight of just how fine a thread 
  anchors us to life.</font></font></p>

  moving lament for the fisherfolk of Sri Lanka by Steve Bonta who doesn't gloss 
  over the difference between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;. And <a href="http://tsunamihelp.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a> 
  is information about where to send donations to aid the survivors of this tragedy 
  (thanks to <a href="http://neithernor.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Dave Bonta 
  </a>). Mass destruction caused by nature or by humans, it's always the innocent 
  who suffer. And the guilty, in both cases, carry on destroying like there's 
  no tomorrow. At least nature doesn't know what it's doing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033">On a scale of insignificance, 
  one being the most insignificant and ten the almost significant, the news that 
  I spent Christmas and the past few days in bed with a raging bout of flu would 
  be number one. So why mention it at all? Because the fact that the body can 
  decide to wipe out our plans and dreams hadn't struck me quite so clearly before. 
  Today I began to feel more normal - the barbed wire wrapped around my chest 
  is loosening, the bucket of phlegm attached to my nose is draining and limbs 
  ache slightly less. But for a while there I really thought I might have to cancel 
  Egypt. When we think we are in charge of our lives, able to come and go as we 
  please, masters of the universe, the body can say &quot;NO! Remember that you 
  are merely dust&quot;. Allright, it was only flu but a lesson nonetheless. I 
  do believe the spirit outlasts the body, yes. But you need the body to get your 
  spirit to Egypt, don't you?</font></p>

  EARTH TO THE FAMILY OF MAN</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033">Instead of a more traditional 
  seasonal image I've decided to post this as my greeting card for all who drop 
  by here regularly or who just happen to be passing by at this time. It's a photo 
  of a work I've just finished which will be shown in an exhibition of works on 
  paper to be held at the 20-21 Visual Arts Centre in Scunthorpe (North Lincolnshire) 
  from 12 February to 30 April 2005. The original measures 77 X 70 cms and is 
  a wall-hanging consisting of six handmade paper sheets stitched with coloured 
  threads and linked together.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033">I was thinking of my own family 
  (father, mother, two daughters and a son) when I drew the stylized heads but 
  then I started applying gold and this had the effect of transforming them from 
  the particular to the universal. Although they bear a vague ressemblance to 
  actual persons they are now metaphors for the spirit which is eternal in all 
  of us. They don't belong to any particular age or place or ethnicity or religious 
  tradition yet they seem sacred, transcending the material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033"> I'm offering this image to you 
  with my very best wishes for the season, however you celebrate it. I've also 
  made a greeting card from the &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; heads and 
  have been sending it by email and snailmail to friends.</font></p>

  <br>
  <b>THE CASE OF THE BOOTS NOT MADE FOR WALKING</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000033"><img src="blogimages/badboots.jpg" width="320" height="240" name="badboots.jpg" border="1" align="left" alt="These are the boots."><font face="Verdana" size="2">It 
  was love at first sight. We mutually winked and twinkled. They were Augustine 
  boots, I had drawn them in my cartoony dreams. I tried them on at once. Perfect: 
  jaunty, comical, bold but not brash, assertive but not pushy, chunky but funky. 
  The problem with the price could be overcome by not thinking about it and stroking 
  my credit card.<br>
  <br>
  So I bought them and took them home and did not wear them for a month. But finally 
  I could no longer put off the risk of sullying my solemates and I put them on 
  for the private view of the <a href="http://www.visitlondon.com/whats_on/event?id=59644" target="_blank">London 
  Artists Book Fair</a> at the ICA (Institute of Contemporary Arts). To get there 
  entails walking from home to tube station, down and up some stairs inside the 
  subway, out at Charing Cross Station, across Trafalgar Square and various pedestrian 
  crossings, under the Admiralty Arch into Pall Mall and then a fair distance 
  along the Mall to the entrance of the ICA . If by then my feet were tired it 
  would be normal. They were not tired. They were traumatised. Wounded. Acutely 
  aware of every single bump and scratch and pebble and dip in the pavements of 
  London. I met my friend/sister-in-law in the ICA entrance and tried to explain 
  the full physical and psychological import of my chiropodic agony. She was sympathetic 
  and gave me her arm to lean against. Putting a brave face on, I wobbled up interminable 
  stairs, chatting to strangers and fellow book-artists. Did I really pay attention 
  to the occasionally marvellous work on show? Does art matter if your feet are 
  burning and you've been betrayed by boots you believed in? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033"> I had to make the same journey 
  in reverse, on the same feet, to get back home. In the final stretch, only a 
  few hundred yards from my door, I considered sitting on the pavement and howling. 
  But I behaved rationally. I sat on the sofa, took off the bastard boots and 
  examined the soles of my feet. The part where the toes meet the round fleshy 
  bit was inflamed and corrugated as if gravel had been ground into it with a 
  steam roller. Strangely, the pattern on my feet matched the corrugations on 
  the soles of the boots. I put my hand inside the boots and the penny dropped: 
  beyond the fancy designer label (JOCOMOMOLA de SYBILLA) the pretty leather lining 
  was as thin as a slice of Parma ham and about as efficient in protecting the 
  foot during the act of walking on city streets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033"><img src="blogimages/bootedout.jpg" width="192" height="400" align="right" name="bootedout.jpg" alt="Booted out" border="1">You 
  may have noticed that I am good at complaining. So good that family and friends 
  often ask me to do their complaining for them. I am the Cyrano de Bergerac of 
  Righteous Indignation. It must be righteous. I won't bother with common or garden 
  or unjustified whining. I looked at the Customer Service address on the back 
  of the boots' receipt and fired off an unassailable email as well as a copy 
  by snailmail. Against me was the fact that more than a month had elapsed and 
  that I had worn the damn things. But I explained my case at length and ended 
  by asking if these boots had actually been tested on human feet. The reply came 
  quickly and was apologetic, even grateful for my feedback which would be passed 
  on to the buying team. I was advised to bring the boots back to the store for 
  inspection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000033"> Essential to the art of righteous 
  complaining is the conviction that you are right, they are wrong, but you're 
  going to be nice about it. It was in that frame of mind that I returned to TopShop 
  in Oxford Street. For the benefit of those above the age of 16 who don't know 
  TopShop or similar department stores, it is the equivalent of medieval (or contemporary) 
  torture chambers. Their instruments of torture are sound, light, heat and overcrowding. 
  The sound is a brain-crunching million decibel repetitious incessant insane 
  inane pounding noise known, I think, as heavy metal. The light is from flashing 
  video screens everywhere, forcing you to watch said insanity disporting itself 
  live. In between are racks and racks and rows and rows of garments, some quite 
  tempting, fighting for your confused attention. It's hell, the real thing, the 
  genuine Inferno. But, like many people, I go to hell sometimes because you can 
  find bargains there. Anyway, I was waiting in line at the Refunds desk, desperately 
  hanging on to my indignation whilst the brainwashing audio-visual effects tried 
  to beat me into submission. I handed the boots, my letter and the reply to a 
  pleasant, submissive sales assistant who went to fetch a manager. The manager 
  read the letters, heard my impassioned plea, examined the boots and went to 
  get a second opinion. She returned saying they sell a lot of these boots, no 
  one else has complained and there are no manufacturing defects. I bit my inner 
  child's lip, counted to ten and did not say that most people do not complain 
  because they don't know how and they're afraid to. Instead I suggested that 
  a foot-size 37 (U.S. 6) sales assistant could put on the boots and go out walking 
  on the street for about half an hour. This and further reasonable remarks from 
  me seemed to have a mind-altering effect and the manager said that she couldn't 
  give me a refund, but as a gesture of good will, she would let me go and choose 
  other things in the store for the same amount.</font></p>

  Nada. Rien de rien. Consulted the very old manual, tried various maneuvres. 
  No use. Phoned boiler repair service. Got the answering machine. Too cold to 
  work indoors. Stayed out all day doing some errands and wasting time. Came home 
  and the boiler was working. But the phone was dead. So was the computer. And 
  the lights in the house were dimming on and off. Went out to make a couple of 
  calls from a phone booth. It didn't work.(Don't have a mobile phone. Don't want 
  a mobile phone). Tried another booth, succeeded. Warned people I was incommunicado. 
  Went back home and to channel my agression watched <i>I'm A Celebrity Get Me
